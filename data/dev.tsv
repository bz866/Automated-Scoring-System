15244	6	"Besides The facts That docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on The empire State building would cost over @MONEY1 and add a lot of Stress to the buildings frame, Smith wanted to pursue his dream.Unfortunatly, he couldn't do that. There are @NUM1 big reasons. in paragraph @NUM2 it says most dirigibles are too flammable. That's because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Just like the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed in fire in New Jersey. paragraph @NUM2 says docking The dirigibles is plain dangerous because The Wind would cause them to @CAPS1 all over, Rather than being docked on The ground and being weighed down. Lastly, It wasn't legal. Paragraph @NUM4 states ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. was another practical reason."" The dirigibles would not be high enough in The air to be legal, and it was highly dangerous because pedestrians below."	3	3		3																					
15245	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as an attempt to allow dirigible to dock there.  In paragraph @NUM1 it shows an obstacle the builders spaced.  ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""  This is because the wind.  The wind would shift due to violent air currents."	1	1		1																					
15246	6	"In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a moor mast was necessary. One could not simply Place one on the empire state building because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized a disaster it would cause if it hapened in New York. Nature was also an obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as it could be in a field. It was a risk not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such elevation over urban areas. These were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	4		4																					
15247	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When it says in the passage, ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" this means that the architects would have to modify and strengthen the building for a ""thousand-foot dirigible"" to land there. Over @MONEY1 of changes had to be made for this. Safety was another problem. Dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been destroyed by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would cause the dirigible to swivel around, which would be dangerous. The architects came in contact with many problems."	3	3		3																					
15248	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirt dribbles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle faced with the fact that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas."	3	3		3																					
15249	6	"When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and fandation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always Shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the bulders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work."	3	3		3																					
15250	6	"While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al @CAPS1 idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.What's being built all the problems became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey... ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas. The builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
15251	6	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. If this happened then they never would have been able to land.The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger. I was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. It was just too dangerous to attempt.	3	3		3																					
15252	6	"Many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were issues that should have been thought about before construction began. At such a height their whirlwind issues that could push the derigible in undesired directions. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). After the Hindenburg exploded the concerns for the same thing happening was a large safety concern. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2 Line 6)"	2	2		2																					
15253	6	"There were several obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. First, if a dirigible was ""moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The framework was not strong enough for this. But the main reason was safety. It was known that most foreign dirigibles used ""hydrogen rather than helium"", which is highly flammable. Things wouldn't go well if there was an incident in a populated place like New York. Also, the winds causing the ship to swivel around, and lead couldn't be used to weigh it down for safety reasons. Finally, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which makes it illegal for any dirigible to even come close to a building. All of these reasons contributed to why docking dirigibles would come with many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
15254	6	"Most dirigibles from outside of U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, New jersey, On May 6, 1937, the ownes of the Empire state Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated area such as downtown New york."	2	1		2																					
15255	6	"From the story the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make it accessable for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the winds at such high altitude, ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not low around, but also needed a way to support the weight of the dirigible because of the already heavy building. These are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with."	2	2		2																					
15256	6	"After reading the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it easy to see that this project faces numerous obstacles to overcome. The builders of the Empire State Building have a lot on their plate in order to allow dirigibles to dock their. For example, the builders have to modify and strengthen the @ORGANIZATION1 frame and also construct a mast to which dirigibles could dock.If there was to be ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,... (@NUM1) it would add an enormous amount of stress to the entire building This is why the steel frame of the Empire State Building has to be strengthened, and ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building also have to construct a mast for the dirigibles. In the end, ""...the architects who designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself"" (@NUM3). This idea of adding a mast for dirigibles to the Empire State Building creates much work for the builders.This excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 easily illustrates the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building have to overcome. From modifying the frame to constructing the mast, these builders sure do you have a greatly increased workload."	2	2		2																					
15257	6	"Many things went wrong while trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the Empire State Building. First, allowing this dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building ""would add stress to the buildings frame"". -@CAPS1 @NUM1. These Dirigibles are highly flamable and over a very populated place like New York City could be very dangerous. The winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""-@CAPS2 @NUM2. If lead weights were used they could fall from dirigible and kill civilians. The biggest obstacle was that a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This seemed to be a good idea on paper but when actually attempted it was too unrealistic."	3	3		3																					
15258	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstecles in attemping to allow dirigibles to dock there. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. to solve this problem, Al Smith built a mooring mast. This would allow dirigibles to anchor their for several hours to refuel."	1	1		1																					
15259	6	"the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles and challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including how to attach the mast and how to move people between the dirigible and the building. In order to attach the mast where the dirigibles would land, the builders could not simply fasten it with the cable teather to the top of the building. This would ""add stress to the building's frame"" with the combined pressure of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure. Therefore, the builders had to get the pressure down into the ground by strengthening and altering the building's steel frame.Another obstacle the builder's faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to a dirigible floating in the air. The dirigibles would only be tethered by their front ends, but gondola, where the passengers rode, was located underneath the dirigible. this meant the construction of ""a gangplank to an open observation platform"" from which the people and luggage had to be moved @NUM1 floor by a special elevator. Although the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in building the mast, the one they really should have considered was the dager and impracticalness of docking dirigibles @NUM2 stories over New York City."	2	2		2																					
15260	6	There are many problems the dirigibles had with docking.  The one problem there was is a lack of suitable landing space.  There was also the problem of winds.  The wind would cause a major problem for if they could dock.  The wind could cause it to spin around the building causing injuries to people or the dirigible.If it's swong around an hit the building it could cause structural damage.  The dirigible could also explode into flames if a spark is caused from it hitn the building.  It could end up like the hindenburge.	2	2		2																					
15261	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe.        Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there."	3	2		3																					
15262	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles (Blimps) to dock there was that there were way too many risks that were being taken to make this mast and it was just too dangerous.I think that the mast opposed too many risks because for one it would be flying too low and two, if it caught on fire or was hit by lightning it would explode and people would get seriously hurt, OR the mast could snap off!As @PERSON1 said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.""@CAPS1 @PERSON1 Clavan means is that the fact that there are so many problems with mooring air ships to this ""mast"" that it just isn't safe to go through with right now!"	1	3		1																					
15263	6	"Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldnt just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the dirigibles load and the wind would add stress. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways."	3	3		3																					
15264	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock their. First, the expectations of the project were unrealistic because there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1 even if they found a safe way to land dirigibles they would be breaking the law. Second, there were ""violent air currents."" When they tried to dock the dirigible on the building, it could not get close enough to it to land because of the wind. Lastly, it was a huge safety hazard. Most dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is very Flammable. In a densely populated area. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [bad an] accident could have been. As a result, dirigibles never fulfilled the expectations of the transportation of the future and they did not dock on the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
15265	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people."	2	3		3																					
15266	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obsticles. One obsticle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanding @NUM1 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. @NUM2-paragraph @NUM3). All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic."	2	3		3																					
15267	6	"The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered problems from its introduction until its conclusion. The first problem was the original design of the building. The original design did not include a dirigible docking station. When plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. To adjust, an additional @MONEY1 were spent in order to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking. The next problem became imminent after the Hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen-filled dirigible that caught fire at the Empire State Building which cause significant damage. Moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant. Wind proved to be another obstacle. The force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles. The fact that many tall spires lined the @LOCATION1 skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock. Finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that law prohibited low flying aircraft in urban areas."	4	4		4

15269	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building faced attempting to make the dock for dirigibles.The architects desgned a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. They would have to make the Empire State Building strong enough to have the wind blowing around up on top. In the late run they would have to face the law. These are the obstacles that the builders had to face.	2	2		2																					
15270	6	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building were, They had planned for dirigibles to tie to the mast could not because the way of the height of the building was @CAPS1 high dirigibles would not be able to keep @CAPS2 while unloading. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the goodyear blim columbia, attempted a publicity stunt Where it would it tie up and deliever a bundle of newspapers"", ""Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had Never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of newspapers on a rope dangling from the blimp"". other obstacles were, that dirigibles outside the united states had hydrogen in them Instead of helium, and hydrogen was very flammable."	2	2		2																					
15271	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles. Nature itself. Even if the dirigible was tethered up to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly over too low over urban areas. Although two dirigibles attempted but failed, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared."	2	2		2																					
15272	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame, the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this. Also the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, this is usualy fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usualy land but dangling that over a city is a very dangerous. Anothe problem is the law stating no aircraft flying to low over urban areas. Finaly dirigibles never caught on. So the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles In their attemt to make a dirigible docking station."	3	3		3																					
15273	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. To prevent this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified in strengthened and to accommodate this new situation. Secondly, most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners realized that if one of the hydrogen dirigibles were to catch fire just like the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, @LOCATION4, the accident could be much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle that the builders were faced with was violent air currents while the dirigible was tethered. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to winds in using lead weights to weight the back down, where they would be dangling above pedestrians would neither be practical nor safe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	4	3		4

Even if the Dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasnt safe."	3	3		3																					
15275	6	"Based on this excerpt, the architects had to go through a lot of obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First they had to redesign the building's frameworks because the weight of the dirigible would add stress to it. Then they added two more floors to the top of the building. They were to be the boarding area for the passengers. Two months after they finally reframed the building, they put the American flag at the top of the mooring mast. Soon after, they realized proceeding with these designs were foolish because it was unsafe and not practical. Those are obstacles that the architects had to go through in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
15276	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the obstacles faced was when trying to dock on top of the building. Since it was so tall, there were very harsh winds that the dirigibles could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it couldn't, because ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, ""the @CAPS1. could not even take his hands off the control levers."" because the dirigible might bump into other buildings if he did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught on fire like the Hindenburg it could be a huge problem. ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were allowed to fly down to it. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building"	3	3		3

15278	6	The builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem is the docking a dirigible to the roof would add too much stress on the frame. Another is having all the flammable gases above a highly populated area. Also there was already a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship to unstable.	2	2		2																					
15279	6	"In the excerpt there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. Al Smith saw an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the top of the building allowing dirigibles to ancher there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. With this idea the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts, by taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the pacific Ocean. Now as you can see the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	1		2																					
15280	6	"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a lot of work. They had to spend a whole lot of money and it wasn't a easy job.

15281	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building the workers faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was safety. While the dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked its body would sway in the breeze. This lead to a question of safety for the passengers getting on and off. Also there was no safe way to weigh the dirigible down, like when the dirigible lands in a field. Any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians.  Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area The main obstacle was nature itself. There are very violent winds at the top of the Empire State Building which would cause the dirigible to sway. Docking at the Empire State Building was too complicated for the idea to be completed."	3	3		3

""The greatest reason was one of safety: dirigibles outside @LOCATION1 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible was to catch fire on top of that building it could do a lot of damage. The next reason is there are ""laws against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The Empire State building was built in the middle of downtown, if something was to go wrong the dirigibles could harm a lot of people. Another reason is because of nature. The author stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This put the dirigibles at risk of hitting that building or another. The last reason is because ""the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed."" If the law and safety hadn't been a problem there would be no way to land a dirigible because they didn't have the things needed to land it. The obstacles made happened because they failed to fully look over their plan."	4	4		4

The wind was an obsticle because of a big gust of wind came it could not building materials or even workers off the building. A second obsticle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady.

15284	6	"The mooring mast was a failure from the start.  The builders and architects were not looking at the problems that would be present but only at how to build the most.  The first main problem the building workers faced when attempting to allow these dirigible's to land was actually building a mast atop the highest building in the world.  Then came the necessary modifications needed to improve upon the buildings framework to support the zepplins weight putting stress on the building after being pushed around by winds 1, 250 ft above the ground.  Perhaps the most important aspect of bringing these large zepplins over heavily crowded areas was safety.  The aspect of safety for pedestrians below would have been almost non-existent had the idea been carried out.  For example, some of those zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen filled blimp combusted over a city, it would seem pretty immenent people below would be harmed.  This project seems to present far too many obstables for these architects to overcome for docking a single blimp."	2	3		3																					
15285	6	"The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was competing with the Chrysler Building in being the tallest building. Al Smith, the governor at that time, didn't want to be beat. Being the governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building developing it into a dirigible dock.As time went on, the building ran into more problems. Tying a thousand-foot dirigable to the building, would add stress to the frame. ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to be accomadate this new situation"" The frame around the building wasn't durable enough to hold a ""blimp"" The building would collapse while taking other buildings down. sixty-thousand dollars went into re-fining the frame but in the end, the building still failedAfter the frame was stable enough, more problems ocured. ""The greatest reason was one of safety Dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it flammable."" Not only did the reason of safety of people went aganist the Building so did the law ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" once Al Smith realized even the law forbidded this, all plans that rose into action stoped, and the Empire State Building remained the same."	3	3		3

It was meant to be the modern way of travel, but many problems surfaced changing the plans. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a major safety hazard! Another problem presented itself ""[A] law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If anything were to go wrong with the ship many people would be put in danger.

The mooring mast goal was really starting to be dowstable when one problem wasn't realized. Safty, as most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of oxygen, for example ""a German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey, since hydrogen is very flamable. Because of realizing this, the situation could've been ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also ""nature itself"", was the greatest obstacle, as Shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around, even if it makes it to the mooring mast.

The most prominent obstacle was that posed by nature, which was that there was always a constant change in wind direction, so the dirigibles would not be able to land safely. The architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below Also, the building had to be a ceetain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated. If it was not an something exploded, the heavily populated city of New York would be in grave danger.

Another obstacles were making the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose. It was very hard to make the mooring mast fulfill its purpose because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.

The dirigibles would ""swivel around"" because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could put pedestrians on the street in danger because the ship is on top moving and could be unstable. Another obstacle is safety. Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Other countries ships could set on fire in the United States and put people in danger. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet and loading off could be unstable because of the winds. The last obstacle faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore it was illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the buildings safely. All these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger."	3	3		3																					
15297	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building obstacles can be described in the following ways. First of all, the main obstacle was the nature of the mast. They described it as, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the dirigibles would dangle on top of the building, which wasn't safe for pedestrians. Lastly, there was a law for airships that couldn't fly too low or too high. The above explains the obstacles of the Empire State Building for dirigibles."	2	2		2																					
15298	6	"When the architects and builders were planning on how to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced many obstacles.  An example of an obstacle they faced was they had to construct the mast so it wouldnt fall off when a dirigible docked.  They couldnt use cable.  tether to hold the mast down because it put to much stress on the building's frame and foundation.  Another obstacle the builders had to face was how to strengthen the Empire State Building's frame.  In order to get the Empire State Building's frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Those are some examples of obstacles builders had to face."	1	2		2

But then there was a problem they had to consult it to allow it. Irving then let Al know that the building wasn't going to be done on time, because of the mast. That's what the Empire State building faced during its contraction."	0	1		1																					
15300	6	"Throughout the designing and construction stages of the Empire State building's mooring mast, builders and engineers confronted many issues including, the distribution of building stress, fire hazards and the constant shifting caused by winds.

According to engineers making the ""thousand foot dirigible moored at at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame..."" @CAPS1, the building would require ""over sixty thousand dollars"" in redesigning and modifying the current building's foundation and framework. Secondly, engineers and builders never considered the fire hazards, which they were confronted with after the completion of the mooring mast. The American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, making that gaseous-filled transportation highly flammable."" An example of this safety violation occurred with the burning of a dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey, causing builders to reflect on the possible severity of this possible accident in the heavily populated area of New York. Thirdly, New York had ""violent air currents"" which could cause the rear of the dirigibles to swivel and shift. The only possible solution was to way down the back with lead blocks, but this would be ""neither practical nor safe."" Engineers and builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with many problems and concerns sometimes only addressed by irrational solutions."	4	4		4																					
15301	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a dirigible was moored by a single tether, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" Another obstacle was that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and when the Hindenburg was destroyed, builders realized that accident would have been much worse if it had happened ove a densely populated area like New York City. A third obstacle was violent wind currents that would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, and the back of the dirigible couldn't be weighted down like in open landing fields because that would cause the weights to dangle dangerously above that pedestrians on the street. These were major obstacles, and they are the reasons that the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used dock blimps."	4	4		4																					
15302	6	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". In addition, the greatest of obstacles was truly nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" As a dirigible attempted to succesfully use the mooring mast, the back end of the blimp would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There additionally was a law which dated airships cannot fly that low over an urban area.

The obstacle they could not controll was nature herself. The winds were said to be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" according to the excerpt wich made it difficult for dirigibles to dock there, and dangerous. Also another factor that was an obsticle for the constructors was the building itself. The structure of the building would have to be modified because the dirigible ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" so constructors wolud have to make the building support this tremendous stress. Another obsticle was safty because some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was extremely flamable and dangerous for the massive population on the ground.

To make the Mooring Mast work the builders had to overcome some obstacles. One of the main obstacles was to add on the Mast they would have to attach steal from the Mast all the way down to the foundation. Another was After designing the Mast they had to change the original plans for the building."	1	1		1

If the Dirigibles ever broke out into flames over New York City it would burn the whole place down and kill thousands.      Nature was another big problem. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were shifting all the time. The ship would swivel around the moorings mast. The Dirigibles usually moored in fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down. The weights dangling above peoples heads was very dangerous.

Things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it  was ever constructed. Resons being; Most blimbs from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel, and it would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building.

Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed ballons they can travel for long periods at time of seventy miles per hour. Thoogh dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of travelin modernation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there many thoughout changes in the building needed to be considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure. To suit the buildings with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @MONEY1. Many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable were to much of a risk in the high populated are of New York. Also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.""

Nature was another factor. ""Violent air currents"" made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock. Yet even if these frustrating conditions were not extant, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was illegal.

The safety of all human beings took part in the construction, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". When dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things.

If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currant were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed.

Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock.

This could potentially lead to the building's collapse is due to the strain. Another reason was at such high altitudes, the wind is quite violent and would sway the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither ""... practical nor safe."" (p. @NUM2). If something went wrong, the dirigible could take out another building or worse: fall. A more practical, legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities.

There was no way to be sure that the dirigibles could even dock or be controlled once docked. Lastly, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were always causing winds to change, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street, ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from, ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to get around.

In stanza @NUM2, it say, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This arrived as a huge problem as the architects could not weigh down the back of the ship because it could endanger pedestrians. Lastly, in stanza @NUM3 it states there is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building or even come close to the area. Due to these three obstacles the plan of using a mooring mast became an idea of the past."	4	4		4																					
15321	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public."	4	4		4																					
15322	6	"The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below."	2	2		2																					
15323	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles also known as blimps to dock there. some of these obstacles faced by the builders were that the architecs could not drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand-foot dirigible to the top of the building's frame ""would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM1. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below"". Also it was very unsafe allowing the highly flamable dirigible to coast over a highly populated area. Lastly the article states ""the greatest obsticle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The ship would ""swivel"" around the mooring mast. Dirigibles should be landing in open fields, where they could not dangle above pedestrians."	3	3		3																					
15324	6	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced it trying to allow the dirigibles to dock here are some. First having something this big land on a @NUM1 foot building would add lots of stress to the buildings frame. All of this stress have to be distributed throughout the eleven hundred foot building which was unthoughtof. In order to make the building suitable for all this weight it would cost over sixty thousand dollars and that was alot concidering every thing elsethat they were doing. Those were @CAPS1 a few obstacles they had trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building.	2	2		2																					
15325	6	"The builders of the Empire State building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  Because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  It was such an expensive modification because they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the"" flat roof on the Empire State Building.  The stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's frame would be too much, this was their obstacle.  The builders needed to strengthen and modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired."	1	2		2																					
15326	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly the idea was just not practicle. Having an up to @NUM1 foot blimp is full of flamable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in New York their death tolls would be huge.Along with the extreme perels that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigible to dock at the empire state building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.Overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost."	3	3		3																					
15327	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there @CAPS1 was the actual design of the mooring and modifications that would have to be made to the building. Due to the stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible, structure of the building had to be made stronger. The mast would also have to withstand holding down the dirigible just one cable tether, which would put a lot of stress on the mast and building. Another issue faced by the builders was the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States most the used hydrogen, not helium, in the balloon, which made it more flammable and dangerous. If one ever caught on fire above New York City, it would be disastrous. Finally, there was already a law in place that airships could not fly to low over urban areas. This law made it so that it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to, or even approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, most too great to overcome. When it came to trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the spire of the building."	4	3		4																					
15328	6	"There are afew obstacles the builders had. to face in this project. One of them was was building the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building. The architect building of the Chrysler building made it 46 ft taller. When this was done the builder needed to make the Empire State building taller, but make it something ""as mundane as a water tank"" (@NUM1 ¶ Al Smith) Another example was trying to make it a stop for dirigibles. These things could go up two @NUM2 miles per hour. They were as long a 1 thousand ft. That would take up @NUM3 blocks New York City. They didn't have good landing area. A third obstacle they faced was nature. The wind was always blowing. No matter what they need hangin dirigibles over a city of innocent people was very dangerous."	2	1		2																					
15329	6	"While planning this architectural masterpiece, builders faced many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building definitely did not fulfill expectations. The first big problem was the large amounts of stress to the framework of the building when the zepplins would be moored to the top, also the amount of pull would impact the foundation as well. The second problem was the cost to modify the skyscraper to meet the needs to not stress the framework. Safety was a huge issue as well; most blimps are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, also if it were to explode it is floating over one of the largest cities in the country. With New @CAPS1 geographical positioning the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly shift directions which could cause the zepplin to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly to low over highly populated urban cities."	4	3		4																					
15330	6	"four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. When a dirigible would dock on the mast cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densly populated area like, New York City. Once the mast was built a new problem arised, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the inncodent with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the ballon since they would be a danger to civilians. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the Empire state Building, although two ships got very close."	4	4		4																					
15331	6	"Basically this excerpt is talking about the ""The Mooring Mast"". It is all about the construction. One of the obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced to is the safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote reveals that the dirigibles they made is highly flammable and it's dangerous for people's lifes.  Pretend that the dirigible is on fire while it's flying up high to sky, it causes lifes.     The other obstacle the builders faced to is that it against the law. ""The other reason practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even though the building is the tallest building in New York. But it is still too low for the laws. Airship can not fly that low over the urban area, it causes accidents.         The Empire State Building is over 1,250 feet, which means on the top of the build has strong and forceful winds and the like dirigibles couldn't stop and get close to the top of the building. ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible @CAPS1 Angeles approached the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful wind."""	4	3		4

These are the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15333	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" (para 6). The swinging of the dirigibles body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. The workers had to work for another two monts after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders worked hard to suit the new building for the docking of dirigibles. Unfortunately their work was for nothing."	3	3		3																					
15334	6	"Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building created many obstacles for its builders. Some of which weren't even discovered until finally attempting to do it.The first of the builders problems started with trying to prepare the actual building for the added stress that would be applied when having dirigibles try to dock. They spent @MONEY1 on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building. Then ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower..."" This created lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as made obstacles.There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Finally the builders find out the biggest obstacle which is that it is legal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did. Thinking back on it, it is obvious to see that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."""	3	3		3																					
15335	6	"There were some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the violent wind currents that made the dirigibles rear swivel, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" A second obstacle was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made the mast nearly useless. A third obstacle was that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable. After the dirigible called ""The Hindenburg"" was destroyed, ""the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York.

Another Obstacle would be the Wind, the winds were Shifting because of violent air currents.

15337	6	"The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was very high. The men who built the massive structure should've realized that these expectations were urealistic. Al Smith had planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off/pick up passengers while docked at the @ORGANIZATION1. These plans would never manifest because; for in dirigibles were powered by hydrogen and it is highly flammable which could result in disaster, the winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong, and there was a law permitting aircraft's from flying so low over urban areas.In one incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the @ORGANIZATION1 saw ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]. ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mass was nature itself"" because the wind was so strong. Dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to dock.

If they used dirigibles on the Empire State building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads. That plan was not smart or safe. The purpose to build it higher was just so it could be the tallest building, there was really no good reasons for it."	1	2		2																					
15339	6	"Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications Safety was a major concern.  Battling with the harsh winds would also be a problem.When the idea of the mast was created, not many realized the reality of the concept.  To put an extremely heavy object and attach it to just a tether, was not safe enough.  The combination of combustible gases also suggested pulling down town New York at risk.To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds.

First the building had a flat roof and a dirigible moored to the top, only held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame. Modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself.

Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1).

One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building.

15347	6	"While designing and building the mooring mast atop the Empire State building, the engineers seem to have ignored some seemingly useful information. As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit, and board safely. Also if the law itsself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then its game over. Why even bother if its illegal? Although it seems like a futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, to many things prevented the idea from prevailing."	2	2		2																					
15348	6	"There were many obstacles that the Empire State buildings owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land.

Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be expanded in order for there to be more height added to the building. Altogether this would cost over @MONEY1. The main reason, and obstacle was safety. The owner had to make sure that the dirigible was not flammable, in which it was. Wind and nature also played a big part in deciding to go through with the idea. The strong winds would make the dirigible swing and constantly shift. This would make the dirigible hang over people on the streets of New York, which was not safe.

The dirigibles didn't have the right docking tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The back of the dirigibles could also be swung back and forth when docked which also served as a issue When it came to docking.

Even after this problem was solved, there were numerous obsticles keeping the goal from being reached.The architects had failed to see many of the potential problems with the mast. Not until after the mast was built did they realized that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable was not a risk that the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock a dirigible.Once these obsticles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock a dirigible."	3	3		3

The biggest obstacle of allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock their where the forces of nature, such as wind and gravity. As in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air. Also, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp caused a problem; it was very unsafe to have a possible fire hazard that was @NUM1 feet long, floating close over a very populated place such as New York City. In addition to that, laws that airships could not fly too close over urban areas prohibited dirigibles even coming close to the mooring mast over the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles proved that it was too dangerous and impractical; the dirigible could not even get close enough to tie up.

Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock.

15358	6	"There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, an existing law made it so that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which meant that a dirigible could not tie up to the building or approach the area. Another problem was making the mast strong enough to support a dirigible. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the biggest problems of building the mast was the issue of the dirigibles being filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area."	4	3		4																					
15359	6	"There were a few obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible is a blimp, giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. Dirigibles had a lack of suitable landing area in New York. Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast being added to the Empire State building would allow dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible. The architects and builders had to consult with experts so they took workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, tested the mass and met with president of a recently formed airship transport company. After all those obstacles they could finally build the mooring mast"	2	1		2																					
15360	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the building of the mast of the Empire State Building. The mast was originally added to add height to the thousand foot building. However Al Smith, one of the builders, wanted the mast to ""serve the higher calling"" of providing a docking station for dirigibles. This idea proved to be very challenging. First, the builders had to change the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying in the wind. Lüsted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" When the mast was finally built, the builders faced the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" If one ever fell, hundreds of people will be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Although it was a good idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" shows that it would not be possible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15361	6	"The-builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at each stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical."	3	3		3																					
15362	6	"The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that a thousand-foot dirigibe moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. Also the stress of the dirigibe's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. It would need to transmitted to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars."	2	2		2

Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the @DATE1 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind, Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely."	3	2		3

Workers couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. It was being held by a single cable tether, which added stress to the buildings frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. Later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the Empire State building. One reason being a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in building masts. "	2	2		2

When it explains that if a dirigible was to try and dock and something went wrong and it caught on fire, their would be serious damage done to the people below on the streets. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was the ""greatest obstacle"" in paragraph @NUM2. the fact that the wind a top of the tower would be whipping the dirigible around with just a cable holding it to the mooring mast. Not making it safe for anyone around the building or in the blimp. One other reason the builders had to figure out when building the mast, was that no airships flying low could enter the area as mentioned in paragraph @NUM3.

One of the obstacles is allowing dirigibles to anchor their for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle is letting dirigibles dock because of they need a place to tie up to a mast. It is stated, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which haulled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast"" (Lüsted @NUM1) This can be a problem because the body of the mast could swing in alot of breeze.

For example in the excerpt it said ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The plan never fully went thru because safety was an issue. Fire and people getting hurt on the streets was a big risk they could not make.

Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If the dirigible caught the building on fire, many people's lives would be in complete danger. In conclusion, the Mooring Mast did not work out for many reasons, but safety and the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation were two big obstacles for allowing dirigibles to dock."	3	4		4																					
15373	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the danger that dirigibles posed, nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was emphasized by the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around crazily. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself were that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth modifications."""	3	4		4																					
15374	6	During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders had to face many @CAPS1 in attempting to allow driggibles to dock there.     In the reading selection The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted it discusses many of the @CAPS1 that were faced. For an example an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City. The second @CAPS1 they faced was how to make dirigible's global so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company would use the dirigable's service across the pacific ocean. The architects had meetings with the government about safeways of mooring airships to this mast.     The builders went through many @CAPS1 to use the dirigibles but eventually it wasn't enough to Put the Plan into affect.	1	1		1																					
15375	6	"One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how to do it safetly.

This sentence, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" located at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe.

15379	6	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2).

15382	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting the dirigibles to dock there. Some of the most apparant reasons were because of what the dirigibles were made out of, weather conditions, and existing laws about airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not made out of the safest materials, most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flamible. This would make the docking Station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire. If the dirigible were to ever get caught on fire, the accident would be very severe, since the Station would be over a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the violent air currents atop the empire state building, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it unsafe to dock there. If something happened to the dirigible, it would be unsafe for the many pedestrians below it. The last reason for the docking station not being built is in paragraph @NUM2 because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It would be illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station because of this law. This law is because of the high winds, fearing that they would blow the dirigible onto other buildings.

The largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety and actually mooring the dirigible itself. The hydrogen used within the dirigible was unsafe, as hydrogen is very flammable. If the hydrogen caught on fire, especially over a place as densely populated as New York City, many people would be harmed. Additionally, the builders were faced with the task of mooring the dirigible. Dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights. However, if one used those weights to anchor the dirigible above city streets, pedestrians below could potentially be injured. Actually allowing the dirigible to dock brought up another problem for the builders to address: if the dirigible was tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swings around and around the mast to wind.

Nature also played a role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author then discusses how the dirigible would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work, was that a law was passed; a law that prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area.

In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. May 6, 1937, owers of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be devastation to happen above the densly populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fufilled it's destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15397	6	"The builders - designers of the empire state building faced many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. The first, and most apparent one was the frame of the building. The article says, ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof"" (@NUM1). The thousand foot tower would add extra strain on the building's frame. Next was the question of safety. Most international dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very dangerous gas, and if set on fire will make a huge explosion, as an example with the German dirigible the Hindenburg. If that same accident took place over New York City, many pedestrians would be hurt or killed. Also, the wind played a huge obsticle. The winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2) and therefore the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" which would be extremly unsafe. Lastly, and most simply, the law didn't allow for an airship to fly that low over urban areas. All of these obsticles put together caused the idea of using the building as a docking tower to fail."	4	3		4																					
15398	6	"There would have been many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face if the decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there.

""The winds on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast the back of the ship would move around, making it hard for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead wieght then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging over the pedestrians of New York City.The final obstacle that biulders of the empire state @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"".

Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on. It could be a danger to the urban areas underneath. Those were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast, to fail."	3	3		3

15402	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were to build a structure with a stable enough top to be able to hold a dirigible. Once the Chrysler Building became taller than the Empire State Building, however, the idea of dirigibles slowly faded away, unnoticed. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith said he would put a top or hat on the building to make it taller. The only problem is that instead of dirigibles docking there, they would just sit next to the point of the building. If Smith wasnt so competitive, the blimps would have a nice platform to dock on."	0	1		1

15408	6	"Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building: one obstacle the builders encountered was the fact that when a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, it would add to much stress to the buildings framework because of a combination of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure atop the massive @DATE1 foot structure. To solve this, the build had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 with these two reasons, there was already a law against airships height in urban areas and by talking a dirigible at the building would break it.

But before building the mast, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Workers framed to the building all the way up to the 85th floor, But before the framing for the mast could take place, the roof had to be completed. Before advancing to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disasterous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" set a good example on why they couldn't do it. The area around the building was too densely populated. The dirigible had a strong chance of resulting in a disaster over New York City, considering the violent air currents. The project was simply too risky, but was a great idea involving future transportation."	3	3		3																					
15410	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem was safety. When the front was masted to the building the back would move around. Another big problem was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Also, it was illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas. Another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of wind."	3	2		3																					
15411	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered major obstacles. The first puzzle posed to the builders concerned the structure. They realized that, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted... to the building's foundation."" This reality caused builders to spend over @MONEY1 modifying the building. Although the builders were able to rectify the framework of the building, the later obstacles were unable to be conquered. After the Hindenburg accident in 1937 ""the owners of the Empire @CAPS1 Building realized how much worse that accident could have been"" if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city became a concern. Until the blimps were less flammable, it wasn't plausible to take the risk of housing them in densely populated areas. The final obstacle of the success of the mooring mast was ""nature itself."" The violent winds that whipped around the 101st and 102nd floors would spin the dirigibles around the mooring mast. This was ""neither practical or safe."" Overall, the obstacles the builders faced proved to be fatal to the success of the mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
15412	6	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof because it would add stressing to the building's frames. So they had to modify the building's frames to strengthen them. Also most dirigibles rather use hydrogen which is highly flammable and destroy a population of New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds constantly shifted and the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast making it unsafe for the pedestrians below. Finally another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building was because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3		3

An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He imagined the top of the Building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. It seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. The first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in New York City. They would have to clear about four blocks in the bussy city! The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor.

15416	6	"A @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the empire state building didn't seem so @CAPS1-@CAPS2 in 1929. Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand foot building, problems quickly presented themselves The first problem architecs ran into was the construction of the building itself. The empire state building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable was the Idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are a uncontrolable force of nature, especially when a thousand feet off the ground. Even if tethered, a dirigible would swivel @CAPS1 too much to be considered safe. The idea presented itself to be inconceivable. A mast was put atop the Empire State building, and the 102nd floor does, in fact, exist. Both of these building's features are out of use, proving to be unsafe to the public."	4	4		4																					
15417	6	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue.

15418	6	"There were many obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. One of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety. Most of the foreign dirigibles ran on hydrogen and the builders did not want to risk another Hindenburg accident in the highly populated New York City. Nature also restricted the building of a dock. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, another threat that the builders did not want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. There were many reasons why the mast was never constructed including safety issues, nature, and an existing law that prohibited low air travel over the city. In the end however, the building of a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe, and the project was eventually dropped."	3	2		3																					
15419	6	"Mooring dirigibles would not be good at all if they were being moored on top of the Empire State Building. One of the reasons that mooring a dirigible on the top of the building is most dirigibles that would come to this dock from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The hydrogen is extremely flammable and after the Hindenburg exploded, it would be to unsafe to have a hydrogen filled dirigibles in a highly populated area such as New York City.Another obstacle that was being faced was a climate problem. This was the biggest problem. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" (paragraph @NUM1). If the winds were this rapid the back of the dirigible would be swinging around freely. This could potentially cause danger if the back was to hit a building near by or start swinging out of control and break loose from the building.The last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law. The exsisting law stated that an airship couldn't fly to low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock at the Empire State Building, it would be too low over an urban area. This made it impossible for the Empire State Building to have a dock for dirigibles."	3	3		4

Which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would also have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. And over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications have to be made to the building's framework The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from sides, with a steps-back design that imitated over all shape of the building itself capital rocket-shape mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny-aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."	1	2		2																					
15421	6	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, the author says ""The greatest reason was one of safety"". The dirigible used hydrogen that was highly flameable and they could not risk it in such a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the wind and nature itself. In the excerpt it said ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents"" This created another safety problem. The wind would sway the dirigible back and forth, and if they used weights to weigh the back down, it would be dangerous hanging above pedestrians. The author explained how ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" This being because it was just not practical nor safe."	3	3		3																					
15422	6	"The problems the builders had in attempting to build the Empire State Building were first of all, the dirigible would have to be tied to the mast and the single cable tether would ""stress the buildings frame."" In paragraph @NUM1, the author says that the wind pressure and the weight of the dirigible could not be supported by the current foundation and so the frame would have to be made stronger and changed. The final problem was when ""Columbia"" delivered newspaper to the Empire State building. The mooring equipment was not installed because of previous problems with the design, laws and common sense used when making this building. The rest of the problems had to do with the obliviousness of reality due to the actual effectivness of the building."	2	2		2																					
15423	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia Lüsted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add stress to the building's frame so steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened."	2	3		3

In every country except the @PERSON1, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and shouldn't be flown over a densely populated area. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the wind speeds at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be tied down on the front and back. Next they would need to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low-flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never finished their plans. Even after @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications the building was not finished."	2	3		3

15427	6	"The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builder's decided to construct the mast they knew that it could not just be placed on the roof. It had to be somehow attatched to the foundation of the building because the dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" Also, after the Hindenburg disaster the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible ""is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to explode over New York City it would not only kill the people in the dirigible, but on the ground as well. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast ""was nature itself."" The wind at the top of the building are very strong and would have swiveled around the mast. The many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any dirigibles to land there."	3	3		3

""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" People wouldn't be safe on a blimp that could expload at any moment. Another obsticle the builders had to face was building the mooring mast itself for docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The blimp wouldn't be able to hold correctaly to the mast and it would move around too much. It wasn't safe or practical for anyone. These are some obsticales many builders have to face, but the ones of the Empire State Building overcame them well."	3	3		3																					
15429	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in there design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
15430	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged the obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there. These dirigibles or blimps were large balloons that were capable of carrying passengers but needed a great landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting blimps to dock there a lot of work and very costly, builders were challenge with safety issues. As experienced to the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would affect the enormous population in the area by killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another challenge to safety that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At mast times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and be punctured. Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians. These obstacles made it difficult to create gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	4		4

Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was in office.Smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. It was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in New York."	2	1		2																					
15433	6	"During the times of the Empire State Building and it's claim to fame with height, it's @CAPS1 Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of it's construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced obstacles. The dirigibles had problems with docking, due to the wind and the elements, the dirigibles had a hard time staying stationary once docked. Another obstacle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually airplanes took the dirigibles position and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still helped the record for the highest building."	3	3		3

The dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway from the back.Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is highly flamable Being filled up with such a flamable gas it could easily turn into a disaster. Especially with all the people who were so close to it on the ground.	2	2		2																					
15435	6	"During the construction of the mooring mast a top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced some obstacles. One obstacle that they faced was that they couldn't just ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, they had to do some work on the building, so it could support it. As the @CAPS2 said, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation"". Another obstacle the builders faced was that if there was an accident, like the Hindenburg, it would be much more dangerous, because there would be many more people nearby, who could get hurt by the fire. ""The greatest obstacle of the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" said the @CAPS2. The wind currents above the building shifted due to ""violent air currents."" Also, dirigibles need to have weights attached at the back of them, but at the Empire State Building, these weights would be dangling high above pedestrians... neither practicle nor safe"". The other obstacle was that blimps couldn't get close enough to the mast, due to the wind, like the Los angeles. Due to all of these obstacles, the mooring mast hasn't been used since."	3	4		4																					
15436	6	"The empire state building's construction workers attempted to build a dirigible dock on top of the world's tallest building but many problems occured during the process.

Having a mooring dock was a good idea but it was never really practicol or safe, many bad things could of happened if it was actually working."	4	4		4																					
15437	6	"The builders had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirgibles to dock at the empire state building but there were a couple main ones. The first main obstacle was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So with that they could not put the mooring mast on top of the building yet until they did some major adjustments. With that big problem the builders next obstacle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The last little obstacle the builders had to face was that the mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that had to be built and put up. Those were some of the obstacles the builders had to face while trying to put a mooring mast on to of the Empire State building."	2	1		2																					
15438	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was all so an existing law against these air ships.Docking the dirigibles to the top off the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen which was highly flammable, there was one incident on May 6, 1937 where the German dirigibles caught on fire. This was known as the Hindenburg's accident. Builders knew this can risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would dock violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. The law against airships were they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas."	3	3		3																					
15439	6	When building the Empire State Building the @CAPS1 wanted to keep it the tallest in New York. They modified the buildings that it would not be succeeded by the chrystler building. It's original property was not to be a mooring mast. The empire state building had to be refraimed then the government banned aircraft too low then commercial airliners took over the avaiting industry. It was too dangerious for dirigibles to dock because the strong currents can blow them out of place causing accidents similar to the hindinburg.	1	2		2																					
15440	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many obstacles the builders are faced with, while in the process of building a dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the hight of the building. That ment more frame work, more material, more safety hazards, all because of the buildings hight. Another obstacle was @ORGANIZATION3 safety. After already building a more secure building, the workers realized that, ""A densely populated area such as downtown New York"", wouldn't be the best place to be if there ever was a accident, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Nature played a great part in a obstacle because it would always be unpredictable. The winds would also wip the backend of the dirigible so it would be unsafe and  unsturdy for passengers. These are some of the obstacles builders had to face while building the famous mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
15441	6	While building the Empire state building people had to go through some obstacle to have it the way they want. They wanted Dirigibles to be able land/bord on the Empire state building. One of there obstacles was the use in New York City and a lack of suitable landing area. The other obstacle was a good one. The use of Dirigibles for the mooring mast was successful.	1	1		1																					
15442	6	"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was of the the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety."	2	4		2

Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it.

15444	6	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of question"	3	3		3																					
15445	6	"Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As in paragraph @NUM1 ""the greatest reason was safety.""

15446	6	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of Hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the United States. This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. When the german dirigible was destroyed in New Jersey the architects of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous it was. Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles At the Empire State Building was because of the law against airships. The law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. These are a Few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which prevented the use of the mooring mast."	4	4		4																					
15447	6	"In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building was a great idea. However in reality, it didn't turn out so well. There are many reasons why a dirgible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example: ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of Helium"" (paragraph @NUM1) This was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for some reason an accident occurred, it could be catastrophic over a densely populated city like New York. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant powerful wind that shifts a lot due to all the different air currents the building creates. If a dirigible docked there, it would be blowing all over the place, if it could even dock at all. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights in the back, but this would be too dangerous to try over a city teeming with people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

15448	6	"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, many obstacles were clearly stated to why the mast was not a good idea. The building of the mast was rushed. Al Smith had realized that he was close to losing the title of the worlds tallest building and quickly put the mast to mind. Problems quickly arose The first problem that had arose was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze. This problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the building of the mast continued. The greatest problem that should have been thought about before building the mast was nature itself The winds were horrible at the height of the building and architects soon realized that landing would be a major issue. The mast was still questioned and architects and engineers were doing all they could to make it work until something was brought upon them, a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The law that was realized marked the end of Al Smith's idea and by the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers have quietly disappeared."	3	2		3

15450	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. One obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building.

The steelframe of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the renovations for the redesigned, chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the level of safety. Thousands of lives could have been lost if a dirigible accident occurred in New York City: ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@NUM2). The biggest obstacle by far was the elements. Dirigibles were easily swayed in times of bad weather: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was very unsafe because of the dense population of people in New York City. If a dirigible swiveled around the mooring mast too much, it could hit another building or crash. The people behind the construction of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties, therefore the mooring mast was never used."	4	3		4																					
15451	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

15457	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3).

Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed.

For example, ""The greasest issues was one of safety."" Safety was a major obstacle because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to explode high above this densely populated area many people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle faced in this attempt was ""nature itself."" Nature was one of many major problems to allow a dirigible to dock. For example, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The winds would shift the ship and it would be very difficult to land on the mooring mast. The other practical problem builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

After Hindenburg blimp was destroyed by a fire, people in @CAPS1 feared that would happen by the empire state building. Another problem they ran into was the law. At that time, it was the law that you couldn't fly an airship that low over urban areas. When tested, some blimps couldnt get close enough because of the heavy winds. This made it impossible to tie blimps up and let people off It also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other building which would put a hole in the blimp It was a good idea, but there were just to many obstacles they had to go around to make the blimp docking station and mooring mast successful."	3	4		4

If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New @CAPS1 walk.

15465	6	"The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the bad location. The dirigibles would be docking 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is hydrogen is what was used in dirigibles and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above downtown New York many people would be killed. This means not many people are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been above such a densely populated area they may have not had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that altitude in New York City there are violent wind currents that are always changing. This makes it hard for the conductors to dock the dirigible and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again the dirigible is falling into downtown New York and killing many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final obstacle was there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other to factor disappear there was a law the builders should have known about that forbade their plans.

If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose."	2	2		2

Another obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around and they could be weighted down with lead weights, using these at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.""

15469	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many factors in the way of dirigibles docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" went up in flames in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building realized quote how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place about a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle was the existing law against low-flying airships in urban areas. This law makes is so that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle of all however, was mother nature. The winds that high in the sky were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and would be unsafe to passengers and pedestrians on the street below. All of these factors contributed to the project never being fulfilled in New York."	4	3		4																					
15470	6	"In a competition with architect building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to construct a taller building with a purpose. That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then their were problems, in the beginning the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since"	3	3		3																					
15471	6	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that. The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns.The weather at the top of the building was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether."	3	3		3																					
15472	6	The obstacles faced by the Empire State building builders were. one was the existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With the dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a cable tether would have put stress on the building therefore they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger	3	2		3																					
15473	6	"The obstacles that the builders were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Is because it would have added to much stress to the frame of the Empire State Building, which could have caused the collapse over a period of time. So the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accomade this new situation"", as said in the excerpt. After the builders completed framing the Empire State Building up to the eighty-fifth floor, it was now time to do the framing of the rooftop to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. After the workers completed the framing of the rooftop, they build the mooring mast on to it, now the builders faced the challenge of framing the mooring mass. The builders framed the mooring mast with a skeleton of steel. The builders faced these challenges in the attempt to allow derilibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	2	1		2																					
15474	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there."	4	4		4																					
15475	6	"Challenges can be faced when radical ideas are put into action. When faced with task of docking dirigibles, or zeppelins, atop the Empire State Building, the builders ran into challenges that are natural to come along with new thoughts. One challenge included was the fact of the wind from such an altitude as the Empire State Building made situations perilous for blimps and people on the ground. ""Even if the dirigible wer tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with the laws of the United States government. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM2) These were some of the difficulties dealt with by builders in the construction of the Empire State Building's mast."	2	2		2																					
15476	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle was the fact that dirigibles were dangerous when not handled correctly. If so, many people could die because it was within a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 was also an issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there; the wind at that height was very forcefull, and would become a problem. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states in relation to the wind, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obsticle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Paragraph @NUM3 states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even a produced area..."" @CAPS2, all of these obsticles made it impossible in the end for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
15477	6	"The builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed. New York has many people that walk everywhere. The builders also needed to considered the violent winds at such a high altitude. These winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel. The winds are constantly shifting. They could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". I think that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast."	3	3		3																					
15478	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. Do to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they eventually shelved the idea. One of the obsticles the builders realized that if a forign dirigibles were to dock and have an accident with any heat or a spark, they would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women, and children, due to the chemicals that are used on forign dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, another obsticle they faced violent winds, that would knock the dirigibles around. ""Winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" All in all the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirgibles to dock eventually shelved the idea."	2	2		2																					
15479	6	In the story construction workers faced a problem. The idea of having a dirigible's dock ontop of the empire State Building was comming to an end. When thinking about the idea the architecture Never put thought in legal persasures as in air crafts cant fly low on urban areas. Also the heavy wind that picks up from the building making the air craft hard to controll. Another was the dangers they could inflict to civilians. If not @CAPS1 right the air craft can get loose and dingle down to urban areas or like the german dirigible catch on fire and Blow up. Even though they had a prototype that work they discontinued the project giving air planes the better way to travel in the air.	3	2		3																					
15480	6	There's more than one obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor on the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	2	2		2																					
15481	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obsticle was nature itself. With violent changing winds and climate, it made it extremely hard to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles will never be tied down to the moor because it would break the law. Safety was also a big reason why the dirigibles could not be tied down to the moor. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. The hydrogen is very flammable so people feared if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, all hell would let loose. These were a few examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15482	6	"In the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over New York City does not seem very safe. And it @CAPS1 wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway."	1	1		1																					
15483	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders wanted to add a mooring mast top of the building, to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, or service, they couldn't do that because ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Al Smith didn't get to allow the dirigibles to land on the building because of how skinny the top was."	1	1		1																					
15484	6	"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin."	3	4		4																					
15485	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 there are many reasons that a proper, working Mast was impossible. there were natural reasons and mechanical reasons. As well as time and safety. Nature played a key role in this project. The winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" because of the location of the building. When the to blimps attempted to go near to test it out One was too unstable to dock and the other through paper down a rope ""after this stunt the idea of the mooring mast was shelved."" @CAPS1 replaced the blimps over time and blimps wher flammable and dangerouse. Also, flying at that hight is illegal."	2	2		2																					
15486	6	"When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently  crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and by law, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there."	3	4		4																					
15487	6	Some obstacles were that there was many sharp rods on surrounding buildings and so if it touched one it could pop. Another is if the wind is blowing it was hard/unsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building.	1	2		2																					
15488	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face. One obstacle being constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand foot derigible could be held by the single tether cable. Another obstacle that builders of the empire state building faced was safety how most derigibles from outside the U.S at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable. This made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the empire state building. These were @NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the empire state were faced with."	3	3		3																					
15489	6	"@ORGANIZATION2's article "The Mooring Mast", explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with Hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dagerous. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making an approach dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire state illegal. Many practical reasons crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State."	3	3		3																					
15490	6	"Many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architect could not simply drop a mooring on top of the building's Flat roof.

Another obstacle the builder @ORGANIZATION1 would be safety. Winds and hydrogen were main focuses.

15492	6	"There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.  This idea was hardly practical, for safety reasons mostly.  If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building.  Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catostrophic.The task of actually docking would be a problem as well.  With such a high altitude, winds were very strong.  Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building.  In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights.  However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York.  Lastly, there was a law against low flying air ships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

15495	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building.

Second, they didn't finish the building because the building couldn't hold all the weight that they wanted to put on top of it. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily.

For one, forign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flamable and would cause a huge fire @CAPS1. Another reason is above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantely shifting. This would make it very difficult to control the dirigible.

Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15508	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified.  The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame.  For this reason they first had to make @MONEY1 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph @NUM1).  The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.  In the end, the fact that there was so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all."	3	4		4																					
15509	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle they faced was nature itself. It says in the exerpt that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here. Another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly to low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that ""these was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of news papers. They didn't have the right equipment so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope. These obstacles were very important to be construction of the mast because it's probably saved the lifes not only the aviators but the people that lived in urban cities below."	3	3		3																					
15510	6	"In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire state Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it did'nt work."	4	3		2																					
15511	6	Their were many obstacles builder face while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. The first problem they faced was safety. Alot of dirigible especialy those from out side the unitestates used hydrogen which is highly @CAPS1. So this was not safe in a place with a big number of population like down town New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because In case of an accident there could be a large amount of deaths. The second ob stacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stable in one place. Instead it would just go around and around the mast. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow air ships to fly too low over urban areas. So It was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire state building.	3	2		3																					
15512	6	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith Announced that the Empire State building would be reaching the height of 1,250 feet; taller then the previous largest building, the Chrysler Building. Smith made the building taller by adding a top or a hat. John @CAPS1 described this as ""[The top of the empire State Building] would be more than an ornament... The empire state building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers"" (pg 1). This dream consisted of having a mooring mass at the top of the building to dock dirigible, or blimbs. However, many obsticles emerged the more they began to plan this, such as the amount of stress it would add to the buildings frame, the use of hydrogen opposed to helium, and simply nature itself. ""A thousand-foot drigible held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame... The Empire State building would have to... [have] over @MONEY1 worth of modifications (pg @NUM1). ""Most diribles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg @NUM1)"".

15513	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mass. Also the body of the dirigibles they could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off."	0	1		1																					
15514	6	The builders faced many obstacles while building a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State building. One was that the had to strengthen the foundation so that all the stress on the buildings structure wouldn't tear it apart. Also the fact it was impractical for a dirigible mast because shifting currents and winds would either make it impossible to land or would circle the blimp around and hit buildings. The workers faced these obstacles and finally realized that they couldn't do it.	2	2		2																					
15515	6	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 outlines the problems architects had when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The idea was impractical, mainly because of safety reasons. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, the dirigible would crash into the thousands of pedestrians in New York City. Nature was another reason why this idea was impractical. In New York City, there was constantly shifting winds that swiveled the dirigible out of control, even when docked. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent the back from swiveling, but in New York City ""they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, air laws prevented the dirigible docks from becoming a reality. It was illegal for the dirigibles to even approach the area because of how low they would have to fly. Mooring masts were impractical and ""never fulfilled its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."""	3	4		4																					
15516	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia amidon @CAPS1 there was a few obstacles while trying to build a dock for the Empire State Building.The first obstacle was the little room they had for a landing spot. New York has alot of people in it and alot of buildings. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" They were very big so they needed enough room not to hit anything else.Secondly was safety. They had to think about all the people and how close it would be to the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the wind blew to hard it could swing it back into the building.Lastly the danger of the weights being over a whole bunch of peoples heads is pretty serious. ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" If one was ever to fail it would probly kill someone. No one would ever get over what happened."	2	3		3																					
15517	6	"Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the empire state Building had to be modified and strengthened to accomodate it with the new situation, which the cost was going to be over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle to allow dirigibles was the mast; an obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. When the dirigibles were going to land the back of the ship was going to swivel around the mase causing it to not be safe."	3	3		3																					
15518	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedstrians wasn't safe. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there."	3	3		3																					
15519	6	"During the attemp in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles that made this idea less and less possible. One huge problem was due to the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below. Refering to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area."" Due to the mainly safety reasons the Docking station for dirigibles was never built."	3	3		4																					
15520	6	"There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big problem they faced was the wind. The way the mooring station was built meant that the wind could catch the tail of the dirigible, causing it to spin around the building. Also, when the mooring station was completed, the wind made it unsafe for dirigibles to get close to the building. Another problem they faced was the stability and support of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's Framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This was so a blimp wouldn't pull the mooring station off the building. One final problem they faced was the safety of the people. It is said that most @CAPS2 dirigibles use flamible gasses to fly. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg over the busy New York streets it would be terrible. There were many problems faced by the building crew of the Empire state building, wind, stability, and safety are just a few."	3	3		3

There problems with the safety of the mooring mast was that, dirigibles that were from countries other than the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen instead of helium. Hidrogen is very flammable so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very great. Also another problem the builders faced with safety was that the winds on top of the building would be much too great to succesfully land a dirigible. The problems that the builders faced with technology was that they didn't have the technology to succesfully land a @DATE1 ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add stress to the buildings frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the buildings frame. The obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast was that they didn't plan well enough and that they should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start."	3	3		3																					
15523	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. The builders of the Empire State Building faced certain obstacles in attempting to prohibit dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern was safety, nature itself, and the existing laws of airships. Safety is a major factor when constructing. The builders had the chance of using hydrogen rather than helium. Risking the fact of how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later realizing how bad it could of been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937. Could of happened to them taking place above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, because the winds on top were shifting constantly. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around, aswell around the mooring mast. The final obatoce was that of the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They feared that the winds would blow the dirigibles into sharp spires of other structures, and puncture the dirigible's shell. In two failed attemps they desided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."""	4	4		4

One of the main reasons was safety, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""

Another problem was the air currents, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

There was no way to keep a dirigible still, even though the front is hooked to the building the back would swing. It was not safe.There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas.

15526	6	"The building of the Empire State building was a project which faced many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, A series of challenges and possibilities were forced to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the addition of a mooring mast to the top of the building, would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. Because of this, over @MONEY1 worth modifications would have to be made to enforc the building's frame and stabilize it is a whole. Laws and regulations about how high airships could hoover over urban areas also restricted the use of the mast as because the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical, nor safe. Furthermore, Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the success of the mast as because many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, this risked a fire hazzard. Lastly, strong winds and violent air currents all in all prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships maybe just a bit far fetched."	4	4		4																					
15527	6	There were many obstacles that the workers had to overcome to succeed in the process of the mast. They had to figure out how they were going to land the big aircraft on the small framed building. Also the workers needed to figure out a way to safely get the passengers on and off the aircraft while the tail was whipping around in the air. They needed to talk and consult with the U.S. Naval Air station because they were leaders in research of the dirigibles. Another obstacle the workers had to overcome was the law against low flying aircraft in @ORGANIZATION3.

15528	6	"Being an architect and construction worker is one of the hardest jobs in the world, especially at an elevation of @NUM1 feet. Building the Empire State building was no easy task. An even more challenging task was building a mooring mast, a docking area for dirigibles, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building."" Architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof. The Architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the dirigible, would add tremendous stress to the building. They had to find a way to ease the stress to the building's foundation. Although the architects faced challenges they did overcome them and planned to put their ideas into action."	1	2		2

The workers wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but realized hydrogen is flamable. Other problems where nature and law.

15530	6	"Many years ago, people sought a new and more practical mode of transportation. Upon being introduced to the dirigible (or blimp), it was believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the Empire State building located in New York City. The project was soon underway, but not without obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, construction of the Empire State Building, and differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles hindered the success of the mooring mast.             It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes all transportation, especially transportation by air, difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This endangers pedestrians.       Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and cost about @MONEY1 to fix.            Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made it very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used.             Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could because by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used another way."	4	4		4

When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of the mass, he seems to be overambitious. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader gets the sense of how competitive Smith was, which is a quality that can get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear to the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a lot of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort needed for this was an obstacle as well. The mast delayed completing the whole building and as @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM2, the mast caused unsolved problems and postponements. A significant reason to the failure of the mast was the issue of safety because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" These both show the impracticality of the installment of a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced.

Secondly, violent air currents cause the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to be constantly shifting. The mooring mast would not work in that environment unless the back of the dirigible were weighted down with lead weights. The lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [would be] neither practical nor safe"". Thirdly the importance of public safety from aircraft had already been reallized in the form of a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Docking in an urban setting proved too dangerous to risk."	3	3		3																					
15543	6	"Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many. ""When the German dirigible '@CAPS1' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1) This shows that if an accident like a dirigibles flaming up above New York, there would be many serious injuries. ""In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mass could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (paragraph @NUM2) The toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was extremely blowing at it. The idea of using the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building was then, dropped."	2	3		3																					
15544	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was finding a way to have a dirigible moored on top of the Empire State building without adding stress to the buildings frame. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (Lüsted). Another obstacle that was face was money. they needed to make more than sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (Lüsted). The biggist obstacle the builders had to face was nature, the winds would shift the dirigible to much. ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (Lüsted). As you can see there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
15545	6	"Although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumutuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These forceful gales made it virtually impossible to manuever a dirigable at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. Another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigable even come close to the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of safety: @CAPS1 are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a density populated urban area would have horrific results."	3	3		3																					
15546	6	"The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.  First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building.  In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15547	6	"In the excerpt, ' The Mooring Mast' I Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the constructors of the empire state building faced many obstacles while trying to create a docking place on such a tall building. Obstacles a law against airships flying to low and nature itself made it hard to create such a place in paragraph @NUM1, it says ' The other practical Reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" There was alReady a strong argument on building the mast but Al Smith ignored it. This law made it illigal for ship to ever tie up to the building. In paragraph @NUM2, the author tells why nature was a problem she says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" Already the @CAPS1 is showing signs of the danger ahead if they pursued the idea any farther. Drigibles moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights. However, using these in the Empire State Building where they would be dangling in the air wasn't practical nor safe. All those Reasons contribute to the Reason why docking wasn't allowed."	2	3		3																					
15548	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast."	3	3		3																					
15549	6	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass. This made the mass unsafe. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete having the highest building in the world."	3	3		3																					
15550	6	"There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done about, was the wind itself. On paragraph @NUM1 it mentions how the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These giant- balloon like machines would constantly swivel around the mooring mast even if they were tied down. The Hindenburg disaster in May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, like downtown New York. The project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area. ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" -says the author on paragraph @NUM2. Incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work."	3	3		3																					
15551	6	"The empire State Building builders faced  different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations ""to learn more about them first hand. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation."" This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles."	3	1		1																					
15552	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the architects went through many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.The engineers had to go through different expirences and consult with experts, and take tours of the equipment that would be used on the project. The architects had to realize they couldn't @CAPS1 drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, they had to realize the consequences and danger, like the wind pressure. Also, fires if a firework you happen many people would get hurt or killed due to New York's population The architects faced many obstacles but then taught them the danger and outcome if building the mooring Mast."	2	3		3																					
15553	6	"There were many obstacles that the architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State building had to face. The first was the fact that derigibles were not becoming the next transportation craze. Without derigibles to use the mast, it would serve no purpose. Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented derigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway. A final obstacle was nature. Fierce winds at the top of the building could spin the dirigibles around, making docking dangerous and impractical."	2	2		2																					
15554	6	"When building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. From the reading excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted stated that dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, tha't four blocks in New York City. This brought up the first obstacle, which is they have no where to land this thing. They couldn't put it above new york because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it support the weight of the dirigible. The biggest obstecle, they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area."	2	3		3																					
15555	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (¶@NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶'s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. the winds up there were very strong, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful."	2	2		2																					
15556	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles durring construction. While designing the mast the architects realized they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on to the Empire State building as this would add stress to the buildings fram. So the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withhold these conditions. Then the builders ran into a problem with safety, the winds on top of the building were violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast. They the decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down but, having those dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastley, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to complete their goal. Overall the planning of the empire state building had many difficulties."	3	3		3																					
15557	6	"When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building realized that if a dirigible lit up on their building, the results would be even worse, for debris would fall on the busy New York streets. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of violent air currents, the winds above the building were constantly changing. Is would mean that even if docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin. Normally, lead weights held down dirigibles in fields, but over New York City would be dangerous for they could snap off and fall to the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws set in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a limit on heights above urban areas, making a dock to the Empire State building, or even just approaching it, illegal. Builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced many obstacles during construction, such as fires, nature, and the law."	3	3		3																					
15558	6	"The builders of the @CAPS1 state building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. Their first problem was that it would add lots of stress to the building. This means if they had a dirigible tied up to the building in the wind it would put weigh on the building or pull it around. ""Nature was their greatest obstacle"" and it was very unsafe to have something like that hanging over the crowded streets of New York. In an atemp to make the building stronger the builders had to spend over ""sixty thousand dollars"" on the improvement of the skeleton or frame. There were also laws in place that did not allow large aircraft to fly low over a crowded city. This tells us that even if they did build the mast it would be illegal for the dirigibles to land there. There were many problems and the landing of a dirigible on the empire state building never happened."	3	3		3																					
15559	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem is safety. Even though the dirigibles was going to be hooked on top of the building the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building. Also after the crash of the Hindenburg the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in New York. Another problem they faced is the laws. The law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas. These problems caused this idea to disappear.	3	2		3																					
15560	6	"From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours. However, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add stress to the frame of the building. One of the greatest obstacle builders faced was the wind or nature. The strength of the wind were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For safety reason, most dirigibles weren't safe because they mostly used hydrogen and hydrogen is flammable. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Due to the obstacles the builders faced, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared."	4	3		4																					
15561	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, Lüsted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As Lüsted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects @MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful."	3	4		4																					
15562	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be illegal. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that it would have been unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable would put people not only inside of the dirigibles, but everyone near and around it, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest one, was the violent air currents causing wind at the top of the building to always be shifting, making it nearly impossible and unsafe for them to land there. Overall, the excerpt has made it clear that the only sensible way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field."	4	3		4																					
15563	6	"To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was difficult. For example, the mast was really hard to build it. The engineers and architects needed to think about how to do it. And made sure passengers' safety. First of all, dirigibles is heavy. Hydrogen might be make it broken. Nobody know what will be happen when dirigibles fly on the sky. The body of the dirigible could swing in the wind. Perhaps out off controll.Which floor can we put the mast is also really important. I think no one like to work under the huge heavy dirigibles."	1	1		1																					
15564	6	"Right now I going to tell us Some of the obtacles the builders of the Empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, In paragraph @NUM1, the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast because Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Second, in paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to this successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Third, in paragraph @NUM3, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This is why never was completed the mooring mast (dirigible) for this serious obstacles to put this in the Empire state building."	3	3		3																					
15565	6	The builders had many obstacles to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. During the @DATE1's dirigibles were a big thing in transportation. The problem was that there wasn't many landing areas for the dirigibles to land because they were so big. So Al Smith came up with an idea to make a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles. The government had to go over Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to have the dirigibles hang onto the building by a single tether wire. It wouldnt be alowed because the dirigibles hanging from the wire would cause to much stress to the building. It was also not possible to have dirigibles to land on the Empire State building because the hydrogen and the dirigibles would be a safety hazard. The hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch on fire and burn the Empire State building down.	3	2		3																					
15566	6	"The owners of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the first obsticles they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steal frame.This was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock. Another great concern was safety, they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of ""how much worse the accident could have been (paragraph @NUM1) if it had occurred in a city like New York. The greatest obstacle they faced however was nature. The violent air currents caused the wind to constantly shift which would cause the docked aircrafts to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). A law which prevented airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear to overcome. This prohibited them from not only docking there, but even approaching the area.

So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell.

Dirigibles were able to dock him by means of an electric winch The problem with this is they were in Downtown New York and New York city was a densely populated area.  A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe.  Also a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable.  So if an accident happens and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be dead.  Another obstacle was the law, Airships cannot fly too low over urban areas.

15573	6	"When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful."	3	3		3

These issues were the building's pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building had not intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to change their entire plan: ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" (par. @NUM1). This was a significant difficulty. Also a concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas the use made fire safety and issue: ""... the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area,"" (par. @NUM2). Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (par. @NUM3).

The builders wanted to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from the country and from other countries, but other countries used hydrogen, rather than helium; and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a metropolis such as New York would be catastrophic! Also, dirigibles used large lead weights to weigh them down.

One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigible's to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph @NUM2.

The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much more worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York.

This was held together by a single cable tether and that would add stress to the buildings frame. All the dirigible's load and wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, but that was eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle is that hydrogen in the dirigible was highly flammable. If a dirigible was ever destroyed it would kill a lot of people because the Empire State Building is in downtown New York.

A mass that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would be @CAPS1 in the building's foundation. The greatest obstacle the engineers @CAPS2 in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation ove a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The final obstacle the builders @CAPS2 was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong. Chapter @NUM1 it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""

Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

The second obstacle was that in order to have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. Another obstacle being dirigibles could not moor or at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There is three obstacles that made it hard for dirigibles to take over the future. That is why we now have air planes.	3	3		3																					
15595	6	"There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirgibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building.

Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1, much revision to the structure's frame was needed. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirgible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp.

These obstacles prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
15596	6	"Allowing dirigibles stock at the Empire State Building was never possible because of the obstacles that the architects faced. First, nature was against the builders. The strong winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting, which proved a hazard to dirigibles. Mooring dirigibles would lead weights was out of the question because they were a danger to pedestrians. Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. The final obstacle was that a dirigible could be accidentally ignited and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg made clear that it was not possible to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15597	6	"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building.

They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.""

Another example is 'A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This shows that the building is not stable enough for landing for a final example ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.'

15600	6	"The use of the mast on the empire state building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. Violent winds, the amount of structural support and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. The high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, and the structural support of such was extremely risky. The main interfering point however was an, ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas.

Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a concern for the safety of the Street Pedestrians. On @CAPS1 @NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"".

15602	6	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would put too much stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable and that put a huge risk in safety for the workers in the building and the people on the street. The dirigible's movements could not be monitored due to violent air currents at the top of the building. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law did not allow airships fly low over urban areas. The invention of docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was unrealistic and unsafe.	3	3		3

The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 they had an idea to add to make it work, would add stress to the building and take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also. The winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable.

What if they were to do this, the Empire State Building have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible. But instead the architects assigned a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower"" and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be complete, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast could fit in its position most of portly the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily mess up the mooring mast, due to winds, which would cause the shifting of the dirigible. Also due to a ""law against airships flying too low"" the dirigible would break that law as well.

15609	6	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself.

Because, the building needed to adapt to the situation, they spent over @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were the safety issues of the new mooring mast. These concerns about the safety arrose from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fir at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Because, the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium the risks were higher. Helium is more flammable. Lüsted writes ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Lüsted @NUM2).

15611	6	"The builders that constructed The Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the framework, also factor in the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the framework would need to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a key problem the builders ran into. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and to have them fly over such a populated city as New York would be impractical. As well as their flammable characteristic there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So therefore it was illegal to tie up, or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind. The winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. There was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building.

15614	6	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were, the framing of the building and the height of the building and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was important because if a thousand feet dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add stress to the building's structure and frame and transfer it all down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and directional change would also push the dirigible according adding more stress *** to the building.The building was at first designed to be @NUM1 floors, but to allow a dirigible to dock there and the load and unload passengers it needed more room and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding area.

They also had to add on more floors on the Empire State building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to still be the tallest building. Now the architects had to had the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, this brought the Empire State building to a total of 1,250 feet. The reason that a mooring mast failed was because the dirigible highly flamable and in a highly populated area like New York it would be tragic. Also nature itself with the wind were violent air current. This would cause the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
15617	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being the safety of the people below on the streets. In the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1 it clearly states that it was dangerous because of the dirigible caught fire it would be ""Much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" Another obstacle would be that there is a law that is stated in paragraph @NUM2 that says that there is ""An existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The greatest obstacle though was nature itself as stated in paragraph @NUM3. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 the wind would make the dirigible swivel around and around the mooring mast. An idea came into plan that said ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights,"" @CAPS1 why not at the Empire State Building? Safety is the reason because the weight on the building would be dangling above people on the street which would be unsafe. Then flyers who approached the building would fear that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would be unsafe."	4	4		4																					
15618	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current.

In every building or project there must the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Dirigibles, or blimps, were not safe in general at the time. If one burned down in the middle of the country, the death toll and cost to repair what was damaged wouldn't be as much as if it burned down in downtown New York City. One, if not the greatest, challenge the constructors of the Empire State was that landing flamable blimps over the middle of a city was a safety hazard which could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts of the city."	3	2		3																					
15621	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", the first line says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like New York. One final obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph @NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
15622	6	"When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled."	3	3		3																					
15623	6	"In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

15624	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced the obstacles of safety, nature, and law in attempting to dock dirigibles atop the empire state building. First, it would not be safe. In the excerpt it stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In a densely populated area such as New York, they couldn't risk having a dirigible burst into the flames and cause massive chaos. Second, nature would not agree. In the excerpt it stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Because of the winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well, and many dirigibles would be destroyed instead of held in place. Lastly, there was the reason of the law. It the excerpt it explained that, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This was the most important reason of all. They could've taken risks on the other theories, but on this one they had no choice. They wouldn't be able to fight the law to allow dirigibles to fly that low. To conclude, the obstacles faced by the builders of safety, nature, and law could not be overcome to get the mast up and working."	4	3		4																					
15625	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships one of the most obveouse reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident accured like a fire, the entire area would be in danger. The modifications made to the building itself were big enough, without needing any more additional work done. The most import reason would be manoverability. The strong winds made it difficult and almost impossable to control the blimp, never less dock it.

To start off, the dirigible's weight plus the wind pressure around the building, caused too much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles there were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). This was a major obstacle along with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below.

Clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose."""	3	3		3

To accommodate the stress sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications, and strengthening would have to be done. Another obstacle was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is flammable. if something like the German Hindenburg being destroyed by fire was to happened in New York the consequences would be much worse. Also, the wind would be an obstacle as well. It would cause the back of the ship to swivel all around the mooring mast. One of the most overlooked obstacles was that of the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and it was illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building. Clearly many obstacles to place in the attempts to allow dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
15655	6	"The builders of the Empire State building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was overcoming the extra stress that a dock dirigible would add. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast author Marcia Amidon Lüsted states ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent weather at the top of the building. Lüsted says ""Even if the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and break the mooring mast."" This was a problem because it would make it unsafe for passengers to exit the dirigibles and walk down a gangplank connected to the Empire State building. The wind also made it difficult for a dirigible to navigate to the mooring mast without being blown into other buildings in the area. One of the greatest obstacles was making the mooring mast safe. Lünden states ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogn rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigibles were to catch fire over a heavily populated area like New York the casualties would be numerous. These were some of the many obstacles builders faced when attempting to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
15656	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced alot of trouble and confusion in the attempt to let allow dirigibles to dock there. This had never been done before @CAPS1 they didnt know what to expect, except for a mooring mast. At first Al smith and his builders thought this was an amazing idea, technology of the future, but things werent that easy. They faced complications with the @ORGANIZATION1 with there research on dirigibles. It was a complicated process because it was @CAPS1 high up in the air, and there was alot of practicing involved. Next was the alterations made to the building, the building wasnt strong enough to hold the dirigible @CAPS1 they make @MONEY1 worth of changes. They finally realized this was an unsafe idea, and it wouldnt be good with the highly flamable hielium, @CAPS1 they were back to square 1. Then the government gave them a law that said no airships flying to low at or over urban areas, wich would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the empire state building. And the top floors were turned into soda fountain."	3	3		3																					
15657	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many promblems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of there problem they encountered when designing the mast. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet. The building was not strong enough, so they had to strengthen the building with a new steel frame. Then the builders also faced safety issues. At a thousand feet the air currents were extremely violant. By the end of the construction it was quickly noticed that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
15658	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers."	3	4		4																					
15659	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced constructing a correct mooring mast for the zepplins, and concerning the safety of the people in the city. They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps.      The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen it's base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable. then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because the people on the street below. Also the chemicals in the blimp were highly flamable and put people around at risk. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured. The builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome"	3	3		3																					
15660	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground."	2	2		2																					
15661	6	"The obstacles the builders of the empire State Building faced, was the lack of a suitable landing area. They will ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuel, or service, and to let passengers off and on"".

The Way that this all @CAPS1 was when the archetect Al Smith wanted to make a building like no other, A building that was taller than the new chrysler building and one that was futureistic. The first problem that they ran into was, what was a building of this size going to be used for? There where many differen't ideas but the one that came to Al @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was transportation. This building could be used for a new kind of transportation where people could board a Dirigible ""also known as a blimp"" at the very top of the building. the next problem was if this would be safe to do because they couldn't have a big problem in the middle of New York. The idea went to Washington to be reviewed and ended up not being safe enough. Al Smith didn't care, His building was the tallest."	0	1		1

15664	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously way not helpful to the project. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed. "	4	4		4																					
15665	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. If that had happened at the Empire State Building it would have had extremely drastic results. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners of the Empire State The building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents...

15666	6	"During construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders @CAPS1 many challenges. If they had just put a spire on top of the building. the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building. other obstacles in their way included low-flying aircraft laws, difficult weather conditions, and safety (if the derigible crashed over New York). For all these reasons the mooring mast was doomed from the start."	2	2		2																					
15667	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she talked about the obstacles facest when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles was the safety, mother nature and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacle was because of safety. Lüsted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch of fire and be a danger for all. Secondly, nature itself would have an affect on the dirigibles. Lüsted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldnt allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isnt safe. Lastly, laws was an obstacle the builders had to face: Lüsted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles. Because you can't build something with it being against the law. Because of safety, mother nature and laws, thats what stop the builders from building the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
15668	6	The @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the high winds and the building struggled to stay up. The builders had difficulty getting the building to how they want it. They kept adding to the building and making it taller. The dirigibles needed it to be bigger so they could see it. The problem was that it kept on breaking or something would go wrong. They kept working on the building to try and get it right but continued to fail. They had to make their plans realistic and that was there major problem.	1	1		1																					
15669	6	"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on letting things dock there was the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said that air craft's weren't allowed to fly that low. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Also it was unsafe due to the hydrogen in the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature was a factor because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the obstacles that the engineers never thought of, the Empire wtate building never became a dirigible landing."	3	3		3																					
15670	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstactles in allowing drigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the safety of New York people. They could have used hydrogen and the dirigible could have caught on fire and landed somewhere bad. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the succesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if they were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast Another was there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared."	3	2		3																					
15671	6	"The builders faced many obstacles while trying to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph fourteen, nature was the biggest obstacle the builders faced. The ""violent air currents"" would cause dirigibles to move around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered. Another obstacle faced, was that the architects couldn't just add a mooring mast to the top of the building; over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. Lastly, as stated in paragraph thirteen, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, even though it was flammable.

15672	6	The buiders faced many obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat surface it took alot of stress and hard work. The dirigible was held by a single cable tether and the dirigible was about a thousand feet. That made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigibles load.	1	2		2																					
15673	6	"There were a few problems with the dirigibles docking on the empire state Building. One problem would be the foundation. If dirigibles were to land on the building it would cause tension on the buildings foundation, @CAPS1 squishing it down. The architects would need to have made adjustments to the Foundation in order for a dirigible to land. Another problem was the way the ship would be docked. when the ship would be docked, it would be a hazard because it would sway back and forth around the mast. Either causing damage or injury to people of New York."	2	2		2																					
15674	6	" There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building.One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrolable, forceful and unexpected. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (Lüsted) @CAPS2 the winds were an issue. Another problem was a law against airships that flew to low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3. The mooring mast idea, was now non-sense."	4	3		4																					
15675	6	"Dirigibles, blimps, were being hailed as the transportation of the future in the 1920s. They had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling.One obstacle the builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith spotted the opportunity for his Empire State building. He was to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, thus allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. Also, it would let people off and on.The problem with this was that the builders couldn't just set the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof if a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the structure, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame."	1	2		2																					
15676	6	"In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. Any man his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun."	3	3		3

Putting lead blocks in the back would be very dangerous. you have lead in the back swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimbs outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammabe, and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread...

The builders and architects had to find a way to allow the stress to travel down the foundation of the building. They spent over @MONEY1 modifying the framework (From paragraph @NUM1).

(Lüsted, paragraph @NUM1) It was reported that the winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. A dirigible on the building would not be able to land properly or be weighted down with lead weights like those in open landing fields.

In addition to nature itself, safety was another great obstacle that the builders were faced with. It is written that, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located.

For example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. Finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. There were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building."	4	4		4

These big dirigibles can be very flammable and having something that major in a very populated city like new york would be very risky and unsafe. The last problem they @CAPS3 was nature. Of course you canot change nature so this was a problem was there since the beggining but was probably overlooked or never even thought about. So this really never would of been able to suscesfuly work without any problems.	2	2		2																					
15694	6	The problems That The empire state building faced was alot of things for one example it was Never @CAPS1 out clearly because They didn't know about The law That aircrafts could Not come @CAPS2 any suburb areas and They really saw what could of happened when The hindenburg burned to the ground. Anthor great obstacles They faced was Nature becuse The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents and This would cause The dirigble To swivel around the mooring mast. one last obstacle That was faced was The structure of the dirigble becuse if it kept on landing on Top of The building it would keep on destroying The building's sturcture. These are some of The obsacles that were faced.	3	2		3																					
15695	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The dirigibles also called blimps were very big, this was a problem because they were to large and could not get to the building and ""most dirigible outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (par. @NUM1) This is bad because an accident could occur and the blimp could explode right over the city and hurt thousands of people The winds above the building were sometimes violent and it was hard for dirigibles to reach it, ""Even if the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (par. @NUM2) It was difficult attempting to allow dirigibles dock the Empire State Building. The purpose in which the top of the building was created could not be used because it was to dangerous."	3	3		3																					
15696	6	"In the making of the Empire Building the builders faced some problems. All of these problems or negative for what they actually wanted to do. Some of these problems were because of what the balloon was made of. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt they say ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could cause many deaths. Also another was strong winds that could carry the balloon and be hard to handle. Last situation would be that there is a law about low-flying vehicles and the balloon flys low. In conclusion the problems they had could not be fixed, so the plan was ruined."	2	2		2																					
15697	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM1). Although at first the builders looked past this, there were many other non-legal obstacles that they faced. There was also a safety issue with docking dirigibles, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ @NUM2). One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶ @NUM3). With all of these obstacles it would not only be improbable, but close to impossible to dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
15698	6	"When Al Smith wanted to make a dock on the Empire State Building he wasnt really thinking straight. That was a horrible idea. Passengers would risk their lifes going on and off the dirigibles. He probably wasnt thinking about safety things and just was going for looks. The obstacles he would encounter words death from idiots that would go up there, weather, and @CAPS1. The weather was a huge factor because if it were to be windy it could through the dirigibles to go off course and crash. The @CAPS1 to make this landing pad would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station. @ORGANIZATION2 wasnt in a smart guy for letting dirigibles for landing."	2	1		2																					
15699	6	"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been to dangerous of a risk. In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock."	4	4		4																					
15700	6	"While constructing the mast to docs dirigibles to the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flamable hydrogen, that could be detrimental to the condensed New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building, if exploded. Also, wind on top of the building was out of there control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it would be unpractical and highly dangerous to the public. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear. The obstacles that stood before the Empire State Building's mast were to great to optimistically believe the project could be finished. It was postponed and became obsolete with the invention of airplanes."	4	3		4																					
15701	6	"The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is the winds on top on the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. Also the dirigibles use Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. So if it blows up, there gonna be a lot of bad things going on in New york. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over Urban areas. The building would have to be modified and strengthened before the dirigibles could go there."	3	2		3

15703	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle.In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways?"	4	3		4																					
15704	6	"In the excerpt  The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that it was strictly hard for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Many dilemmas and complications the builders faced. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work."	2	2		2																					
15705	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first initial issue that they faced was the stress the blimp would put on the building As the article states here, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...the building would have to be modified and strengthened to  accomodate the situation."", the stress prompted the need for further improvements on the building itself; which obviously costs time and money. Another problem they faced was the impracticality of the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles require hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As a result of the Hindenburg disaster, ""the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown @LOCATION1"" Another great issue that presented itself was the inconsistent violent air currents, which made safe docking for the blimps difficult. This problem could be combated with lead weights, but they ""were neither practical nor safe."" And lastly, there was already ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented the blimps from being able to fly as low as the building, let alone land there. In conclusion, the builders of the mooring mast at the @CAPS1.S.B. faced many obstacles in its construction which questioned its safety and prevented it from being practical."	4	4		4																					
15706	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Starting with putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). They had to modify the steel frame of the building. They had to do this all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). This would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So the flammable dirigibles were too dangerous to fly over such a populated place as New York City. Also the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM4). In the end the problems the builders faced were too many, and unfixable, so the docking of dirigibles in the Empire State Building was no more."	3	4		4																					
15707	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was that it was very dangerous to have a hydrogen (highly flammable) filled dirigible dock over one of the most densely populated areas at the time. They could not let the accident that had happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey happen in New York: ""..., The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes: ""The winds on top of the building were consular shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigible would not be able to stay steady for docking or unloading. Other ideas to solve this problem like weights were, ""neither practical or safe."" The final obtacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". As shown, It was simply impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building because of natural causes, danger, and the law itself."	3	4		4																					
15708	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the structure of the building, after the mast was designed they needed a building that could withstand the stress of the mast. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornametation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. They were able to overcome that obstacle. Another obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" @CAPS1 obstacles did that bring? Well, hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey, the owners of the ""Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. The obstable brought upon another obstacle of practicality. Dirigibles customarily landed in open fields. ""The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.

Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead wights on the back of them so they could not move. But there is no where for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

15710	6	"The builder of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the Mooring Mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. Another issue was safety and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably."	2	2		2																					
15711	6	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, if a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether was moored at the top of the building, it would add stress to the frame. The workers had to transmit the stress ""All the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" They had to modify & strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems the frame work, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could do to prevent this, flammability, or existing laws."	2	2		2																					
15712	6	"There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
15713	6	"Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there. One obstacle they would have to faced was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (¶ @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's fram. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as Lüsted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigables down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigables down with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigables to dock there."	3	3		3																					
15714	6	"When builders attempted building a structure to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building in New York, they did not realize how many problems they would encounter. Upon designing the mast on top of the building, designers realized that if a dirigible was docked on to the building, it would add stress to the frame, and therefore, would have to modify the Empire State building's structure. To do this, sixty thousand dollars was needed, as well as more hours of labor. Another obstacle encountered was the fact that nature got in the way, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (line @NUM1). It would be difficult to dock it to the building, because the dirigible would be constantly swaying due to wind, and passengers could not get on the blimp. Furthermore, blimps usually were moored in open fields, with the aid of lead weights to help weigh them down. If lead weights were introduced in New York City, where it was very populated, they could potentially fall while dangling in the air, endangering pedestrians. In conclusion, builders faced many obstacles while trying to achieve docking capability for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4

They came to figure out that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This stress would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation.     The @CAPS1 had to modified and strengthened the steelframe in order to accommodate the situation of the stress on the building frame Also creating the rocket shaped mass the @CAPS1 had to work on many different parts.

15716	6	"The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights. I weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe.

15718	6	"There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause many trageties because it would be above people's homes. For the same reason, there was  a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities.""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""@CAPS1 the safety risks for people below, there was the wind causing a problem that the blimp could not even dock correctly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around."" One of the attempts proved that it would be tricky to land.

Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed desingners discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transimite stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure.

Another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be weighted down as it usualy is, because then thered be massive weighs dangling over the streets. With the winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, Dirigibles would have swayed and moved around. That creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings. Also if the blimp ever successfully moored it would create tremendous stress on the building. Besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed. The first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers. That makes it illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. The second promblem was, the proper mooring equipment were never installed.

Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City.

The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. This accident could have been much worse if it happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obsticle to get around because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around. This is not good because it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Finally, there are laws against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Famous and important dirigibles had lots of trouble with their landing like for example on December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mask but could not get close enough because of forceful winds.

15742	6	"In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced, in attempting dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced, was that they lacked a suitable landing area. Because of this, they came up with the idea of having the passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Another obstacle they faced, was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" In the end, the idea of the mooring mast, was a failure. The builders didnt think about potential problems that could occur. For example, nature itself, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and even fires, due to the gas (hydrogen) used in some dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
15743	6	"If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued. If they were to use the Empire State Building, They would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process. Even then if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. All in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea"	3	3		3																					
15744	6	"Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obsticles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. The building wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire state bilding, it would have pulled the building untill it feel over. The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard. Also dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe. for the people on the ground. In the and it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
15745	6	"While the Empire State Building was being built the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, the one in charge of this project, had a goal to build the tallest building. Right of the bat, the first problem occurred. The Chrysler Building had a secret 185-foot spire inside, and made this building now @DATE2, 46 ft taller then the Empire State Building. The first sign of hope shinned apon Al when he saw an opportunity for Empire State Building. Dirigibles needed a landing area. and the mooring mast does the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop + soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the @LOCATION2. were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like @CAPS1 then there would be a problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building."	2	2		2

Safety issues was a problem because in the excerpt it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This explains why they couldn't do it because of one of the dirigibles would explode in downtown New York it would cause severe damage and losses of life because it's a populated area. Another obstacle was nature. Nature played it's role because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents."" This would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around which was either practical or safe. The last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas. This would have made it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These obstacles had made the builders face problems to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15747	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low. Although, this had happened two dirigibles had attempted to moor there the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to recieve them. In result the idea was shelved."	3	3		3																					
15748	6	"The obstacles the builders faced was mainly safety. Safety was important because of how many people there are in New York. Another problem was the dirigibles outside the United States were hydrogen instead of helium. At such a high height the wind is very strong and the blimps are only being held by the front while the back would swing uncontrolably. A blimp can easily be blown into a close building's sharp spires and pop because of winds. There are alot of things that could go wrong at any time, so I think the right decision was to stop the idea of the mooring mast."	2	2		2

The architects could not want this, they had to make changes. Before they made the changes, they also realized that it was extremely windy up there, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1, it would be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to make the building shorter. After all the work they put in, it still wasn't good enough because there was a law that was ""against airships flying to low over urban areas"". After all the time and hard work they put in, there was, in the end, no way to have this idea be successful."	3	3		3																					
15752	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had obstacles in their way. There were Dirigibles that were one thousand feet long and they had an obstacle which was that they did not have much space in New York to land. Al Smith decided that was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for some hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by an electric winch that tied the ship to the mast. The dirigibles would swing and people would still get on and off safely. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked/talked with experts and got equipment ""and mooring operations oat the U.S. Naval Air Station"". which the navy was the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and knew everything. The Navy offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast. Also the architect met with president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the Pacific ocean. so the builders had many obstacles and attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	3	2		3

Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area.

If a dirigible caught fire trying to dock at the Empire State building, the accident would quickly turn into a catastrophe. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" The high-speed and shifting winds atop the Empire State building would cause mooring dirigibles to branish around the mast.

They would also have weight problems because they didn't have a stable enough frame around the building. They would have to pay alot of money to fix this problem.The last problem was a safety problem.

From this you immediately know that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be properly modified in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast. Another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative. ""... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside..."" @CAPS1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS2, the winds at that altitude would have been to unstable for a dirigible to dock.

They were very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they saw the risks. First was nature itself, winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that the dirigible, which was made to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes, the winds might even prevent the dirigible to get close enough like in @DATE1 when a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but couldn't get close enough. Another issue with safety. It was stated that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they imagined that situation over New York which was highly populated. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by single cable would add stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to modify the frame. These obstacles plus many more showed that that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	4		4

This would be a problem because the vast majority of blimps visiting ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". So if an accident ""had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" it could be disastorous. Another major problem were the winds. They were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and so the ships could swing into other buildings. These two points aside, there was a ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" anyways. So regardless of the wind or the hydrogen it wasn't legal.

""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of abuilding, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". The stress of the dirigible, can cause crucial damage on the buildings frame. Also, it was not only the size the contents of some of the planes caused a crisis aswell. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The worrys of the balloon catching on fire was too much to risk. Along with all, is the power of nature itself. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds on top of the building were very violent compared to the ones in the ground causing a scare. It looked all good until everything was looked at carefully, obstacles came from all different ways."	4	3		4																					
15773	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot For dirigibles also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building Flat Roof... A Thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable Tether, would add stress to the Buildings frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State building, which can cause pressure to the building which soon might clasp. Another @CAPS1 that proves that the builders Empire State faced, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature its self"" The winds on top of the building made it dangerous. clearly there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced."	2	2		2																					
15774	6	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 builders must faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt it states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the wind and dirigible's weight would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, about eleven hundred feet below. In paragraph @NUM2 of the excerpt it states, ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) in an area heavily populated like New York, above a large building with many people, it would be a thousand times worse. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. This left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced so many obstacles that they eventually abandoned the project."	3	3		3																					
15775	6	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith had the idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the U.S.. He wanted to out-do the Chrysler Building, Smith wanted it to be 1,250 feet. His idea was to add a mooring mast. However, issues got in the way such as how highly flamable blimps were, how densely populated the city was, and the violent shifting winds.Blimps are highly flammable because they contain both hydrogen and hellium. on May 6, 1937, German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. New York City has millions of tourists a day, in such a populated area what if something went horribly wrong. The greatest issue was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would Swivel around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1, @NUM1).On May 6, 1937 owners of the building concluded that efforts to make the Empire State Building the tallest building was neither practical nor safe."	2	3		3																					
15776	6	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One of these obstacles was to modify the whole frame of the building. ""A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This quote from the excerpt cleary shows that the builders would have to move around this to complete their job, which would entirely make this situation an obstacle. Another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows another obstacle because builders could not find a practical way to get the passengers off, and putting lead in the back would only endanger the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows a very big obstacle, which actually happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg. Those were the obstacles that were faced by the workers during the time of attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
15777	6	"Many obstacles occured for the builers of the Empire State building and allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was the mooring mast itself. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mass it would swivel around the mooring mast. Another obstacle the builders experienced during this process was the already existing law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Due to the fact that the Empire State building was in New York, an urban area, the dirigable idea would have most likely never worked. The dirigable was unable to fulfill its destiny and the obstacles the builders faced were the main reasons."	3	3		3																					
15778	6	There are some obstacles the builders face during this time while building the Empire State Building. One of the issues was the unsolved problems of mooring airships to fix a mast at a height desirable to postpone installation to a later date. The Empire State Building wasn't destined to ever fulfill its purpose. For reasons it should have been apparent before it was constructed. And another obstactle was the lack of a suitable landing area.	1	1		1																					
15779	6	"There were Several obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was one of sefty. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If an accident would occur above a densely populated area, such as New York, it would be catastrophic. Another obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obsticle the builders had was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."	3	2		3																					
15780	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen: an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as a downtown New York"". With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not safe or a practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem the obstacles of the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great."	4	4		4																					
15781	6	"Complex. A building is a complex structure that cannot be easily tampered with, and still be considered safe. That is the major problem the builders had. It isn't easy you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). They had to strengthen the structure and that took ""sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" (¶ @NUM1). Plus the builders had to design a nice plan for the mast, to make it look nice. They even had to use glass which is a harder material to work with. Although the greatest obstacle the builders had was allowing the dirigible to dock. One it was filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if it ever blew up it would have killed a lot of people in the city. However ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶@NUM3). This was mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM3 and is the main reason why the idea failed. The winds were always constantly shifting, which caused the back to swivel and become unsafe. Weights on the back would have made it even more dangerous, because they could fall. Lastly laws prevented flight so close to the ground. But even so many other blimps tried, like ""Columbia"" and ""Los Angeles"", and found it was too hard to fly that close to building and dock as well. The idea had many holes in it. "	4	4		4																					
15782	6	"In the excerpt, they tell some reasons why it would be difficult for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. In paragraph 6, it says, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and tied to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank of the observation deck."" This shows how it could be potentially dangerous for the passengers of the dirigible to get off. Another reason was that dirigibles were losing passengers in the late 1930s due to the airplane. As it is stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" That quote shows had dirigibles were losing popularity due to the airplane."	3	2		3																					
15783	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flamable because they use hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire and once the Empire State Building noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit. Another obstacle was one that couldnt be fixed, because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definatly not safe. The last thing that stopped them was a law that was against any airships the flew too low in urban areas. All in all, the builders faced too many obstacles to build a mast for dirigibles"	4	4		4																					
15784	6	"Builders had many obstacles to overcome when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area. This obstacle did not stop Al Smith, he saw this as an oppertunity to add a mooring mast at the top of the building so dirigibles could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibley be dropped on top of the roof of the building. The stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. With this the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened costing @MONEY1 just to change the framework. In the end this mooring mast to dock dirigibles never came through and archetects should have seen the potential problems in the beginning."	2	3		3																					
15785	6	"In the Mooring Mast, Marcia explains how Al Smith attempts to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to allow dirigibles (blimps) to station their for several hours. The architects faced many obstacles in trying to adding mast onto the design of the Empire State Building. One of these obstacles were remodifing the building, so the weight of the blimp wouldn't stress the foundation. ""A Thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (¶ @NUM1) A different obstacle that delayed the progression of blimps being dock at the top of the Empire State Building, was because of safety issues. Most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium. And because New York was highly populated, there was no doubt that there would be frequent fires. Even the owners of the Empire State Building realized that this danger, on May 6, 1937."	3	3		3																					
15786	6	"The builders of the Empire State building, who wished to place a mooring mast at the top of the building, faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, and should a single spark enter the balloon, the entire dirigible would catch fire. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [harmful an] accident could [be] if it [took] place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A third reason was that, even should there be some way of holding the dirigible still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that dirigible still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" All these problems contributed to the mooring mast's fate disuse."	3	3		3																					
15787	6	"The first main obsticale that the builders faced was the fact that blimps even though they have propellers and rudders are still at the mercy of the wind. And since the wind on top of the building was described as ""Constantly shifting due to violen air currents"" (¶ @NUM1) it would be impossible to keep the blimps stable while it was moored on the Empire state building. Just docking the blimp onto the building was an impossible feet, the only blimp that even tried to dock onto the Empire state building, the naval dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the building to get the mooring lines on because they where ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of the othe building in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" (¶ @NUM2) causing the dirigible to fall onto the city.The second main obsticale was the public safety aspect of trying to moore a dirigible on the Empire State building There were too many things that could go wrong. The blimp could explode like the Hindenburg, or could run into one of the spires on the surrounding buildings and plumet to the ground potentially killing or severely injuring hundreds of people. That is why trying to dock a dirigible on the Empire State building was an impractical idea."	4	4		4																					
15788	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Those obstacles were safety reasons against it, laws that made it illegal, and nature (weather). In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the building, all aspects of the project had to be safe - but they weren't. ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ @NUM1). A German dirigible had caught fire in New Jersey and the Empire State building owners realized how bad a fire could be in downtown New York, which is densely populated. Secondly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area"" (¶ @NUM2), which would make even trying to approach the building illegal. Lastly, nature was not going to change and suddenly cooperate for one project and it was unpredictable when or if the weather would permit docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around... dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" (¶ @NUM3). Sounds safe, or practical? Definitely not. In the end, all of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were too great to overcome and the top of the building never became a mooring mast for dirigibles."	4	3		4																					
15789	6	"The worker faced many obsticals while building the Empire State Building. Sence Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building he kept adding on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet tall. The builders had to redesine the entier buildings sceleton. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could hold up the mast. The mast was made so that Dirigibles could land thire and people could get on and off it. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders fixed the steel fram of the building with in two months. The building went on as planned. After awhile the people begin to see that the mas couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building."	2	2		2																					
15790	6	"When builders were building the Empire State Building they came across many obstacles. One problem was lack of suitable landing area in @CAPS1 (paragraph 6).

The dirigible were enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the sucessful use of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current.

15796	6	"The builders of the Empire State building had a grand idea of including a mooring mast where dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, could dock themselves. Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to the moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive.Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature. The building was 1,250 feet tall, so the winds up at the top were constantly changing and dangerous, making it difficult for the dirigible remain stationary when moored. Also, something the builders didn't foresee was the laws against blimps flying to low over urban areas.

15802	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced a lot of obstacles attempting dirigibles to dock their. One of the first obstacle the builders faced was realizing that the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. The builder's realized that the wind pressure could make the dirigible swivel which would not be suitable for the foundation of the building. strengthening the building's structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The workers also realize that the dirigibles are flamable and if something were to go wrong it would cause a devestation to a such populated area.

One major problem is that the dirigible was not able to land on the buildings flat roof. This was stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt. Another problem is that they had to design elevators and stairs for the passengers to travel to the top of the building to be able to get on the dirigible. Along with designing stairs they had to be able to build 102 floors just for the area where the blimp would land. This can be supported in paragraph 11 and @NUM2 of the reading.

Another obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock was nature. The wind at times could be too powerful. As said the reading, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These threatening winds would have made it impossible for the dirigibles to land and serve as safe transportation.The last obstacle was that it was illegal. The had @CAPS1 been a law against it.

The Empire State Building was very high so it got really windy. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents.They also weren't thinking about the government when they were building the mooring mast.

The builders were also breaking The Law because there is a law saying how low an airship can fly over an urban area, the dirigibles would be way too low.  The final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air.  This is due to the high winds the airship would be swinging around and could break off.  Another issue would be if it blew up the pieces would fall onto downtown New York City."	3	3		3

The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at @NUM2 feet. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous.

""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) If a hydrogen-filled dirigible would catch fire while at the Empire State Building, it could be very dangerous for both the building and the pedestrians below. The last obstacle was a law.

Another obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegle for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" There was also another problem. It was the building's structure and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast."	3	3		3																					
15816	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was how would they be able to have thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, without ""adding stress to the building framework.""

15817	6	"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first  reason why builders difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas.

Another problem they encountered was the dirigibles were unsafe. The Hindenburg, an event where a helium filled dirigible had caught fire, occured during construction. What if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York. The whole idea of dirigibles was thought of as dangerous. Finally, there were laws saying that no aircraft could be that close to the city. The whole idea of the ""future of travel"" was very unliked and impractical."	2	2		2																					
15819	6	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the empire state building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch of fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used."	3	3		3

15821	6	"@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt "The Mooring Mast" of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle.The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak through proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock.The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it."	3	3		3																					
15822	6	"The empire state building was high in the air, (@NUM1 ft) the problems were is that the building moves while it's in the air, and if you have something that is weighting around the heavy fifty-thousand pounds maybe more than the building might rip off if there is a big windstorm. The dock sounded like a good idea but you would need a winch and you would have to put some big clamps on the building to secure the balloon or dirigible to dock and refuel. In paragraph @NUM2, @PERSON1 of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" If Irving ever decides to put a blimp up and make an air station then make new technology. Who know's in the future we could have cars that fly through air, why not have balloons attached to buildings."	1	1		1

15824	6	"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the many struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. such obstacles included; the pressure a docked dirigible would have on the building itself, the hazards of high winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the chance of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flamibility of the hydrogen if in it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress of the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only thing that put stress on the building, the wind pressure would also. The wind made it difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building because the dirrigible itself to not be able to stay in one place ""Even if the dirrigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flamibility. And since the dirrigible is so close to people, such as tourist on the building's observation deck, the dirrigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly,  the dirigibleis so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity.  For example, when the Los Angeles tested  the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and it's mooring mast for docking dirigibles. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct."	4	3		4																					
15825	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced very difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most difficult obstacles was ""nature itself"". There were very strong winds that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the dirigible would move around and around even if it were ""tethered to the mooring mast"". Also, dirigibles usually landed in open landing fields and would be weighted down with lead weights. However, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about 1,250 feet in a place as densely populated as New York City would be ""neither practical nor safe"". Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", meaning the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unpractical."	3	3		3																					
15826	6	"When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building there were many challenges architects and builders had to over come. First were the basic problems of any transportation hub, how to move people and baggage around the terminal. Another more complicated problem was how the compensates for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This problem was solve by @MONEY1 redesign of the Empire State Building frame. Also mored dirigibles would be constantly swing around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below. The architects could not design a way to hold it drigible in place.

This would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly possessed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream.

So, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service. And to let the passengers on and off there also. The Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line From the front of ship then tied to the Mast.

The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.	3	2		3

Al Smith, the man who wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, was very spacey. Some were as long as one thousand feet in length. So a mooring mast sounds fitting. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel as well as letting the passengers off and on.Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire S Building's owners to realize how bad it would be if it happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building is always changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the streets. Another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building.On December 1930, U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to forceful winds. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the controls in fear.

15846	6	"The mooring mast atop the empire state buildings problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind. On land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. Also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. After the Hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles."	4	4		4																					
15847	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. For one just letting a thousand foot drigibles land on the top of a building was a huge obstacle.. By having the dirigible on the building held on by one cable tether was bad. So the builder had to work on the steel frame of the building so that the dirigible wouldn't add so much stress to the building. That was a huge obstacles the builders of the Empire State building had to face."	2	1		2																					
15848	6	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which the were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project."	3	3		3																					
15849	6	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was finding a way to terner the end of the blimp without it blowing in the wind or putting the people below in danger. Another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. One final obstacle was the danger of hydrogen dirigibles in general. These obstacles proved far to many to outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast.	2	1		2																					
15850	6	one of the obstacles that had to face was they had to make it taller because it was sapoosed to be the tallest building. They also had problems with it so they had to keep fixing it.	0	0		0																					
15851	6	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	2	1		2																					
15852	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The number one obstacle was safety. The builders thought to themselves, How are we going to safetly land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground, while its freely floating in midair? Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. Its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded. These obstacles were real and these are some of the reasons why the idea of landing a dirigible in mid-air slowly went away, because it wasnt the most logical idea."	1	2		2																					
15853	6	The obsticals that the builders face in attempting to allow dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building are the law to fly that low to buildings. They also face structural problems in the building to be able to hold a dirigible. They also could not keep the dirigibles from moving because of the wind. They faced safty ishuse because of some dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and it is highly flamable. They did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area. They did not want what happen to the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey to happen in down town New York. Dirigible have never dock there and never will because it is unsafe.	3	2		3																					
15854	6	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the creation of The Mooring Mast, and its purpose to extending the height of the Empire State Building. Although during the 1930's the concern of the Mooring Mast serving as a docking area for drigibles, also known as today as blimps. After the 85th floor frame was built and the skeleton of the mast of steel and stainless steel glass windows, issues concerning the landing drigibles arose within the public.There were @NUM1 major reasons why the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never really completed. One reason was because of safety. The excerpt explains how dirigibles from outside of U.S used hydrogen instead of helium. And, using hydrogen is extremely flammable. They used the example of the German diriglie Hindenburg being destroyed b/c it was on fire in @LOCATION1.Second reason was the problem of wind currents. Winds were extremely violent. Dirigibles would move and sway alot b/c of the strong winds. And the moving dirigibles being that they were at least @DATE2 ft long dangled high above urban areas which wasn't safe at all for people walking under it.Thirdly was the issue of it being against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas was also a safety hazard for people. It would be illegal for dirigibles to be tied up on mooring mast above cities filled w/people risking that it might fall onto people."	3	4		4																					
15855	6	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, was determined to create the tallest building in the world; even taller than the Chrysler building being @NUM1 feet tall. He also wanted the building to be aesthetically pleasing, and nothing ordinary. His determination led him to the idea of the mooring mast, which in itself came with additional obstacles. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This meant that the frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Other obstacles included the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable, and could have caused a giant chaotic mess if over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" meaning that even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel everywhere, which was ""neither practical nor safe."""	3	4		4																					
15856	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle the builders encountered was the dirigible ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame"" (@NUM1). The frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened for the project to work. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flamable. Anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds. The mooring mast was not a safe idea that could never have worked."	3	3		3																					
15857	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. The builders couldn't just let the dirigible land that the step of the Empire State building. It would put to much pressure on the building. According to paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" It would have cost sixty thousand dollars worth of modification had to be made to the framework. Another obstacle they feared was they noticed how much worse it would be if the dirigible caught on fire on top of the Empire State Building. It would destroy part of the population because it would be in downtown New York. In paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. It says even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the State building, where they would dangle above pedestrians was not safe."	3	3		3																					
15858	6	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building the building originally was going to have a flat roof but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast.Another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the derigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be designated to passengers. Experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds.	2	3		3																					
15859	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to think about the Safety of allowing the dirigibles and their passengers dock there. They had to think about the winds at the top of the building. The wind currents change violently at the top of the building and because they wouldn't be able to weigh the back of the ship down, the dirigible would spin around and around the mooring mast. They also had to think about dirigibles from other countries. These dirigibles used hydrogen which is more flammable then the helium ships."	2	3		3																					
15860	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.Although this sounded like a great idea and seemed possible at first, it was not. The idea of the mooring mast of the @CAPS1 State Building was neither practical nor safe. In paragraph fourteen, Marcia states why this dirigible idea wasn't so safe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. In the last sentence of paragraph fourteen, the author states another reason the idea wasnt safe nor practical. ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"""	1	1		1																					
15861	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to dock dirigibles on the mast. One major problem was that the original Empire State Building, ""...could not simply drop a mooring mast,"" on the top of the building because the ""...single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame work. One reason dirigibles were never docked on the mooring mast was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" This makes it impossible for dirigibles to even approach the mass without being impaled by other buildings. There was also, ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made it illegal to even dock airships on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles contain hydrogen which is ""highly flammable."" If the Hindenburg incident had taken place in New York, the accident would have been ""much worse."" These reasons contributed to the builders' problems, and explain why the mooring mast was never used."	4	4		4																					
15862	6	"The builders of the empire state building could not build the moor mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is too high and the roof of Empire state building was to flat. Building the mooring mast takes a lot of efforts because they have to care about wind pressure and holding cable on top of the building. They design the @NUM1 floor with glass to make observation area and boarding area for dirigible passengers. However it has a lot of problems the building. At first the helium is flammenble so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They think greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast is nature because winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air current, so it can pratact from worst accident but it is still not safe."	2	2		2																					
15863	6	"Intended uses for buildings often are met with challenges. In the article ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by @PERSON1, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are discussed. The first obstacle faced is stated in paragraph @NUM1, when to build a dock on top of the building the entire building would have to be inforced. This was an obstacle because it would be at a cost of @MONEY1. Another obstacle faced was the weather. Above the building violent air currents rage. These currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring. The final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law. According to the article, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The cost of reinforcing the building, the weather, and the laws were three obstacles faced in docking blimps to the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
15864	6	"The workers' constructing the Empire State Building faced many problems while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles, two of which were that the winds at that height were unpredictable and foriegn dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to Violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock up that high. The high winds could cause loosening of the dirigible which could cause it to go flying off, which is unsafe to the pedestrians. Also, ""Most dirigibles from out side of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard the workers ran into. If something were to go wrong the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down to a large amount of pedestrians. These two are reasons or problem workers ran in to when deciding whether to not it would be safe or easy for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast uptop the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
15865	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off @CAPS1 is a major concern many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second off the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding @CAPS2 from flying to low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace.

For an example ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In conclusion that is one way how they faced the obstacles.In another way how the obstacles and builders of the Empire State Building faced to attemting to all dirigibles to dock there is by transportation. In my own opinion transportation allows people to go to one place to another, For an a example ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future.

For example they said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"".

15871	6	"Just like in life there are many obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention that can't be easy. So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them."	2	3		3

15873	6	"While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock their, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First off it was against the law to have air craft fly that low to the ground. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so having that fly above a heavily populated area would not be to safe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, therefore the dirigible could be pushed into the side of a building and get punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen."	3	3		3

If a hydrogen zeppelin were to catch fire over New York City, it would be disastrous. It could start a huge city fire. Also, the wind was capricious up there, and would make it extremely difficult to dock and stay docked. The Navy tried to, but was unsuccessful, because the wind did not allow for them to even get close to the mast. Third, there were laws preventing airships from flying too low over cities, which really put an end to the whole idea.

One obstacle that the builders faced is the lack of suitable landing area on the roof. For that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible. Later they had to put a steel needle on top of the empire State building so the balloons could dock up and let people out. Next obstacle that they faced was that ""outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building. Another reasing of an obstacle is that it was against the law for airships flying too low over urban areas for it can tie up and forceful winds will blow it in different directions. For that reasoning the winds could force the balloon to go in different directions and hit other building if the winds are strong.

Nature also proved to be an obstacle because ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" that was neither practical nor safe. It would also be difficult to control the dirigible once it is tied to the mast because of the violent motion that the dirigible is in. There was also an existing law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it illegal for any dirigible to even get near the mooring mast or tie to it.

The owners of the Empire State building realized how bad a dirigible fire would be, and more so if it took place over the densely populated city of New York. Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship which swing around, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allowed airships to fly low, or too close to urban areas.

One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3

As you can see the use of hydrogen would provide a great hazard to New York City as a dirigible was landing on the top of the building. It is a highly populated spot and could be potentially very dangerous. Another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph @NUM2.

The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships did try to land.

One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
15886	6	"The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was there was a it was illegal for ""airships to fly to low"" over urban areas. It was illegal for it to ""tie up to the building. ""The purpose of the dirigibles was to be able to dock at the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented."	3	3		3																					
15887	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock tere. Many foriegn dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to keep it a float. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and has proven to be. on @DATE1 a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire caused from hydrogen, in New jersey. When the owners of the Empire State building the severity of this happening they were turned off.Nature if anything was the biggest obstacle of them all. Considering the building was so tall, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"". The law if anything was pretty important to get approved, and tere was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So it would make it illegal for the dirigible ships to ever tie up to the building or to even approach the area."	3	3		3																					
15888	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street.

Since ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Building's flat roof,"" The builders had to modify the building's frame. These modifications cost over @MONEY1. The other aspect that posed an obsticle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank. So, to fufill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside.

Luckily the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the Empire State Building. Another obstacle to the builders was nature. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents.

Several other problems arose due to pedestrian safety issues: most foreign dirigibles used highly-flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that should the hydrogen cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose there lives @CAPS2 the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded @CAPS3, endangering countless pedestrians. @CAPS2 there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""

The wind also posed another problem because if the captin let go of the controls the dirigible might spear itself atop another pointy sparer, thus leading to the other high buildings to be an obstacle. The Law of the day also became an obstacle ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"" (@NUM3 line 1) the building itself was high up but even at the top it wasn't legal for any airship to moor due to hieght restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State building would have sent to New York spirling up ward to being in the land inovation but the obsticles were to great to surpass."	3	3		3																					
15899	6	"There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigble the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close The second problem was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"" which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage. These precautions would have to be taken which were obstacles for The Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
15900	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to derigibles. Most foreign derigibles still used hydrogen; a highly flammable gas. A fire on the streets of New York would be disastrous. There were also fierce, ever changing wind currents above the building. These winds would make the back of the dirigible ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1, there was a law in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low when over urban areas.

This would cost a large amount of money to construct. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, the passage states the issue that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

15906	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal. They had failed to predict the potential problems that they would face.

They realized the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets.

""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the wind.

If their dirigible got blown off course it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings.Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building."	3	3		3

They should have realized previous to the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyways.The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrolable wind conditions.

One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers.

If this happened in New Jersey how bad would it be in a densely populated place like New York City. I could never imagine walking down the street and a lead weight being dropped on my head. In New York there was violent air currents and when the dirigibles would be tied up they would sway. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights. This was not practical or safe. The one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law. It was illegal for a airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings.

The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart.

15923	6	"There were many obstacles the builder's of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles were the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the buildings flat roof, a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. Also if they wanted to do this, it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constatly shifting due to violent air currents. To reduce this dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, but the obstacle to this is having weights dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. All these obstacles, yet these people were still able to build the Empire State building with a mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
15924	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. As stated in paragraph 1 of the excerpt, the Empire State building was planned to be the tallest building in the world in the @DATE2's. The architect of the Chrysler building constructed the building to be 46 ft taller then the Empire State building. Governor of New York, Al Smith did not want loose the tittle of the tallest building. In paragraph 6 it tells you Smith's idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. And to let passengers on & off.Safety issues did not allow the mooring mast of the Empire State building to fulfill its person, said in paragraph @NUM1. Most dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable. Because of pointy buildings this was extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM2; the greatest obstacle was nature. On top of the Empire State building, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also, the law to fly too low. By the late 1930's the mooring mast plan disappeared."	3	3		3																					
15925	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  First, there was the problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building help by a single cable tether which would add stress to the frame of the building, all the way to its foundation.  To fix this, the frame of the Empire state building would need to be strengthened.  Another problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below.  Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames.  Also high winds would make it hard for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast.  The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets.  The effectiveness of these winds was shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock.  During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings sharp spires.  Those are several examples of what builders of the Empire State building had to face."	3	3		3																					
15926	6	Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the buildings frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cant moor your ship there because you are flying to low. In December 1930 the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there but they were affraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen.	2	2		2																					
15927	6	"Derigibles, modernly called blimps were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and greatest form of transportation there was. These derigibles needed quick means of refueling and unloading passenger both eficiently and with safety. At the very time these derigibles became popular modern day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was heading efforts to construct the Empire State Building came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building which would help dirigibles dock, refuel and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns found later by Architects. These safety concerns included fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many obstacles stood in its path to glory."	2	3		3																					
15928	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there ware extrem to over come.one obstacles for the builders was trying to make it so the building its self could handle the stress of the dirigibles tied to the to the building with wind pulling at it and swaying back and forth as wind direction changes.Also it is to low for a dirigibles to be flying because of the other buildings. The most important is the gases inside the dirigible is flamible and would be devistation to the people below in New York City.	3	2		3																					
15929	6	Diregible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 The owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York        In The MOORING MAST          Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty mile per hour and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling some were as longht as four blocks in New york city The one obstacle to their expanded us in New york city was the lack of a Suitable landing area	1	1		1																					
15930	6	"In the @DATE1's Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in New York. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's mooring system ran into many problems One obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These wins caused the dirigibles tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offsAnother obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This was feared because of the Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials feared if that crash were to happen in New York then the damage would have been catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and had a crash occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties"	3	4		4																					
15931	6	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Constructed in the 1930s the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's height was its great mooring mast that stood atop the building Dirigibles, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that held back the progress of this project. Most of these issues were safety problems. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing law against airships flying too low to urban areas Another reason was the flammibility of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the ship exploded many civilians and passengers would be killed. In summation, because of safety risks, the mast of the Empire State Building could and was never used for its original purpose."	2	3		2																					
15932	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. ""... the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This means it was difficult to land the Dirigibles. Another problem they faced was nature. The wind and weather could make a landing the dirigibles very dangerous. ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast."" (@CAPS1 6). This means if the wind blows in the wrong direction, or competes with the electric winch, it would be difficult and dangerous to land the dirigible. Another obstacle was the expenses. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This means they had to pay a lot of money, which is an easy. That was definitely an obstacle they had to face."	3	3		3																					
15933	6	"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it."	2	3		3																					
15934	6	The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced was harsh. They had to figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land on the mooring mast. A another problem was that the government was getting unpaticent. What made thing worse was Al smith was being sneaky and unturful. He lied about how high the actulty hieght is. He lied about how he will fix the problems the was with the mooring mast. They were also afraid that a dirigible will blowup on the mooring mast like the @CAPS1. So they just put it aside and made over time the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the use by the sightseers.	1	1		1																					
15935	6	"One problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long. If the just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building becaus the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame. If they did the weight of the dirigible and the wind all of that stress and pressure would be put on the buildings foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below which was not safe at all. They had to go through all of the different possibilities and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe. While designing the mast they had to consider the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did design a good mast the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe."	3	3		3																					
15936	6	"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"", meaning that the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow fly through the winds and could be tied to the mast it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, A dirigible is not leagally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" Which there is an ""existing law"" against. This is a problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be leagally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a feul. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Because of potential fires, city laws, and air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast"	4	3		4																					
15937	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION3 the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. One reason that it was difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was safety issues. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With New York City and its dense population that is a risk that cannot be taken. Another obstacle faced by the architects of the Empire State Building was nature itself. The start of paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With high winds the dirigible, even tethered to the mast, would swivel around the mooring mast. Another difficulty in docking the dirigibles was according to the excerpt in paragraph @NUM2, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Due to this law it would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. A final obstacle the builders faced was the advancement with airplanes and that made it difficult for dirigibles to be the prime source of aeronautical transportation. Even though the builders spent a lot of time and effort in making the Empire State Building a national @CAPS1, which it is, they neglected many potential problems with the mooring mast which led to it never accomplish its full potential."	3	4		4																					
15938	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon lüsted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
15939	6	work face many problems with building docks for dirigibles to land on docks attched to the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that dirigibles disappeared and did become the transportation of the future. The Empire State building Never got to forfill its purposes for dirigibles.	1	0		1																					
15940	6	"When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places populated as New York City. Another obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose."	3	3		3																					
15941	6	"Based on the excerpt, obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast, and rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."	1	1		1																					
15942	6	"Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many obsticals came forth with building the Empire State building with Al Smith constructing the whole building. With Al Smith constructing the whole building, he was determined to outstrip the height. Al Smith secretly constructed a 185 foot spire inside the building, the shocked the media and public by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler building. Another obstical that was faced during the building of the Empire State building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. The idea of having the dirigibles being docked at the top of the Empire State building, the dirigibles would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add amounts of stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstical that came to building the Empire State building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U. S. Used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is very flammable and if anything to happen it could destroy New York. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced my obsticals in the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."	2	2		2																					
15943	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced several challenges in the completion of the landing dock for dirigibles. The first problem was the frame of the building. The frame was not strong enough to support the dirigibles when docked so the had to reinforce the frame to withstand the strain the dirigibles would present. The next problem was lack of a suitable landing area They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building but the violent winds at the top of the building would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the ancor because of fear that the dirigible might be speard by a nearby building. Another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked on the top of the Empire State building is because of a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. A couple of attempts have been made but to this day nobody has successfully docked a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. 	3	3		3																					
15944	6	"The Empire State Building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in New York City's @CAPS1, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law.The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated @CAPS2 this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, & ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over @NUM3 feet with pedestrians below There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking.Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the Empire State building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM4). The law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat."	4	4		4																					
15945	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen which was highly flammable and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it such a densely populated area. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line @NUM1) This would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably. This would endager pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles made docking a dirigible here impossible."	4	3		4																					
15946	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders found many obstacles on the way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building Some of those obstacles were as follow. The main concern was the safety of the passenger boarding and unboarding as well as the people below The concern for the people below was how the dirigible sometimes was floating with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. So they didn't want chances of the dirigible blowing up. Another main concern was there was an ""exsiting law over airships flying to low over urban areas"" (par @NUM1) The dirigible floated with the air and being as long as @NUM2 ft. the back of the dirigible where it wasn't securely fastened would circle around the mooring from the high wind currents. The winds were shifting all the time so it was a very big safety issue. Another obstacle was the dirigible docking, was mainly put into place because of jealousy. The man was jealous because his competition Al Smith was catching up with him before the idea of dirigible came to mind."	3	2		3																					
15947	6	"Base on the excerpt the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Practicity and safety were an obstacle because the builders of the Empire State building were the first to attempt a docking dirigibles on air, @CAPS1 they had no past trials to refer to. In this project practicity and safety worked together. For example ""..engineers [had] to dope out a practical, workable arrangement..."" @CAPS1 that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and secure. This would assure the passengers safety as well as stability to the building.The second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" @CAPS2 all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation ""... was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation ""the steelframe [of the building had] to be modified and strengthened..."" The modification to the buildings framework was worth ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" In conclucion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to dock dirigibles in their building."	3	4		4																					
15949	6	"Al Smith and other workers are working on Empire State Building. They been having a few obstales with the project like they can't have it has high as they wanted it.

""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen than helium, and hydrogen is highly  flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on @DATE1.

This proves that there were @CAPS1 with Empire State building that they worked around"	2	3		3																					
15950	6	"The obstacles that were faced by the Empire State Building builders were numerous. First of all, if they had carried out their plans for the mooring mast without taking into account the weight of the dirigible, the building would surely have way too much stress forced on the foundation when it docked. Next, the fact that the dirigible weighs even less than air is both a negative and a positive. The negative side to it is the fierce winds that would take control of the back of the dirigible. Above the many pedestrians in the city, this idea was quickly ruled unsafe. Lastly, it was filled with hydrogen, which, naturally, is highly flammable. The use of hydrogen was very dangerous, and only added to the negative side of the project."	3	3		3																					
15951	6	"They were many obstacles the @ORGANIZATION2 of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen and hydrogen is highly flammable.Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top on the building were always shifting due to the violent air current. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but using these, where they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason why blimps could not more at the Empire State building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

One of the largest obstacles would be the wind factor, causing the dirigible's back end to sway. Another issue, would be having the foreign dirigibles full of flammable gases to be moored too close to a densely populated area. Also, before any dirigibles could be moored, constructors had to spend extra time and money to make the building much more sturdy, to hold the dirigibles."	2	2		2

The Empire State building is over @NUM1 feet tall, at those heights the winds become very powerful and would blow the diridible all over the place. This was proved in paragraph @NUM2. The Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skillful pilot he could not get the Steel framed balloon close enough to dock on the Spire. Another factor the architects did not weigh in to the equation was that most diridibles were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable. If a zeppelin did catch on Fire then that would be on massive ball of fire coming down on the streets of downtown New York. The ""Hindenburg"" gave us the example which was all we needed to see to change our mind about wanting a massive flammable balloon hoovering over the streets of New York City."	2	3		3

In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, taken from The Empire State Building, the reader is taken through the journey in allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the Empire State Building. This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very hard to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, However to blimps did attempt to land there. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both were unsuccessful in landing due to intense winds and sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project is an example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute."	4	4		4																					
15960	6	"Based on the excerpt, I dont think they should have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, I think this because something really bad could of happened and something probably has happend, But back then they really had no choice except for balloons."	0	0		0																					
15961	6	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there. In the excerpt the author states nature is one of the biggest problems for the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The author explains that the wind on top of the buildings are dangerous for the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The author also describes what the dirigible would do as an affect of the wind. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Those were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow derigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
15962	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself."	2	1		2																					
15963	6	"This project towards ""transportation of the future"" for the Empire State Building was no easy task. One of the major obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame"". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to accommodate the dirigibles. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked. Allowing these giant aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was ""neither practical nor safe. These obstacles caused the workers and architects to postpone the build."	3	2		3																					
15964	6	"One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps. This was meant to help New York be a leader in modern traveling. Yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the air currents. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast. The idea of weighting the back was immediately ruled out because of the danger imposed on the pedestrians on the street. Also there was a law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for and dirigible to tie up or even approach the area."	3	3		3																					
15965	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to obstruct dirigibles to dock on the top of there building. They faced obstacles like laws, saftay problems, and also natural problems when trying to successed this gutsey idea. They firsted faced the problems of law, ""An existing law aginst airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed an obstacle for the builders because they would have to dock the blimp without flying in this restricted fly zone. The Second problem was dealing with saftey, ""when dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed... Owners of the Empire State building relized how much worse that accident could have been over downtown New York."" After blimps were proven to be highly flamable the builders saw that an accident over highly populated New York City would be worse than a rural area. Finally the builders face problems with nature, ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The builders relized that the drastic change in @LOCATION2 at the top of the building where not apperate for a blimp. These designers had more than a mundane idea but it was shot down with the multiple obstacles that a-rose."	3	4		4																					
15966	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". This is stating that the stress of the dirigibles and its shiftyness will put stress on the buildings foundation and they don't want that stress to topal over the building. Also they say ""The winds on the top of the biulding were consistantly shifting due to the violant air current"". this says that they are worried  that the wind might take the balloon away from the building causing it to injure people these are only a few obsticals the builders had to face."	3	3		3																					
15967	6	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and hard obstacle to over come is saftey for everyone. The builders had to worry about the safty of the people coming in and out of the dirigible, the people on the near by streets and to the people in the side of the building. Saftey was one of the main reasons why the dock never was completed.Another huge obstacle that faced the builders was nature. This is true because winds at the top of the tall buildings were always changing and this would make it hard to land the dirigible on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, Dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights and this would cause a problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets."	2	3		2																					
15968	6	"There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" These are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to alow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
15969	6	"The idea was kind of unrealistic in the first place. When these dirigables would try to dock to this building, the structure of the building wouldn't be able to handle the violent winds and the zeppelin. It caused many problems. What if the dirigible attempted to dock and the heavy winds blew it's tail end around to hit a building. The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this occurred in such a heavily populated place, it would be chaos. Impractical and unsafe, this plan wouldn't work. They would need something more stable. The plans of this weren't completely thought through. All these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear. These plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never happen. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel."	3	2		3																					
15970	6	"The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there."	3	4		4																					
15971	6	"The idea of the dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was very smart and could've been great. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems when trying to achieve that goal. One problem was the wind forces were two strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (¶ @NUM1). Another reason is the safety of the people. Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (¶ @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to take in to consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (¶ @NUM3). The docking at the Empire State Building was a great idea but there were too many challenges that faced the builders."	4	3		4																					
15972	6	"Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. So the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the ship and then tied it to a mast so by swinging the body the passengers could safely get on and off."	0	2		0																					
15973	6	The problems that the workers had to face in letting the dirigibles dock at the empire state Building were crusal & @CAPS1 Because first if they would of tried to Put Mooring Mast on the top of the Building Roof And then have A thousand pound Dirigible on top of It holdn @CAPS2 would be to Much for it to hold. And the stress of the dirigible's weight and wind pressure will need to be transmitted to the Buildings foundation which was 11 hundred feet Below The frame of the Building would have to be stronger Modified @CAPS3 it could work But it would be Over @MONEY1 to Put into the Building frame work in order for it to succeed But the Most Reason why it was difficult for the workers is Because of the winds And if landed they would need weights to weigh it down but it would be dangling high above Pedestrians witch wasn't Practical or Safe.	2	3		3																					
15974	6	"While building the Empire State Building many obstacles had occurred. During the process of planning the @CAPS1 of the building architects started to realize that there could be many complications.Several complicostions occurred during the process. Architects noticed that the building itself was not made to add additional parts. As an architect said ""it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Wind was another harsh factor for the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ""held by a single cable tether, it would add Stress to the buildings frame. The engineers will also muched with the building's issues."" the Steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.Safety and nature also had a big play in the obstacles of the building of the Empire State Building. Architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up. wanting to do this could be very dangerous. ""dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe. Building the dirigible would have caused many accidents, injuries, and deaths if made. Nature would also be inroled in this plan. ""open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If anyday had very fierce winds this object could have came down and caused serious danger."	2	3		3																					
15975	6	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building is a dock unrealistic."	3	3		3																					
15976	6	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon Lüsted the builders went through many obstacles in the attempt to allow dringibles dock on the Empire State Building. At first Al Smith wanted this newly designed building to be the tallest one in the world. Now this 1,250 foot building would reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing drigible to dock there. Passengers to get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refuling its engine. Although this was a great idea there were many issues that the constructor did not see, This is because the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage, to ensure that no damage or harm would be put on the building or residents of New York the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be strengthened. This cost the city of New York over @MONEY1 in the hopes of putting it on the map for modern travel."	2	2		2																					
15977	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were lack of area, populated area, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" Hydrogen is very dangerous and it's flammable and Empire State Building is located in a populated area, so it's dangerous to risk. Also as German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it proved to the owners of Empire State Building that it's more dangerous than it looks. Other reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the top of the building was the existing law agains all airships flying too low over populated areas."	2	3		3																					
15978	6	"In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to come up with a safe plan which included building designs and figure out problems they failed to see from the begginning.The first obstacle was meeting with the navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan. They had to find a way to land the dirigibles without adding stress to the buildings frame and without spending @MONEY1 to strengthen it. The builders came up with a plan that included what the mast would have to be made of and what wold be on each floor. They even had to finish the roor before the mooring mast cold take place.The largest obstacle was one they failed to see from the beginning. In building the mooring mast, they would have to face obstacles that nature brought, which was simply impossible. Safety was the main problem. if a fire occurred, there would be a disaster. The winds were too strong due to violent air currents and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low. After all this work, they couldn't get passed the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built."	3	3		3

Their first problem was; ""[t]he architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of... the flat roof"". The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modifie and strengthen the steel frame of the empire state building. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flamable making it highly dangerous for on two moor overapopulated New York city. Also nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were just so strong it'd be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. The mooring mast atop of the Empire State building was a good idea but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely and against the law."	3	3		3

It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased. They made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of New York  Also, according to the aricle, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""

Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen. Also that the wind currents have a stronger force that high up in the air than to regular life level.

Safty was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flamable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploaded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pusing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it.

An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building.

Also, due to natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down docking dirigibles. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State building did not correspond to existing laws.

A most important one was safety, in that that many foreign dirigibles to use helium to float which is highly flammable. A disaster like the Hindenburg disaster over New York City is too dangerous to risk. Another preventer of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights due to the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication of making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place.

The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.

16000	6	"It is stated in the article that ""[t]he mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose,"" and that proves to be true. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in trying to have dirigibles dock at the building. For example, one obstacle that is faced is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is an extremely flammable gas, and if a dirigible is destroyed by fire like the Hindenburg it could cause a terrible accident in a heavily populated area like New York. Therefore the builders face an obstacle of a safety issue with the dirigibles if one catches on fire in New York. Another important obstacle is that strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building causes the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, which causes the dirigibles to not get close enough to the mooring mass. Also the wind creates a risk that a dirigible could be blown onto a sharp spire of another building, ""and the dirigible could be punctured which causes a dangerous situation for the captain. To weigh down the dirigible so that it does not swivel as much in the wind, the controllers would have to use lead weights. Though the lead weights lessen the swiveling it is not practical or safe because lead weights would be hanging above pedestrians on the street, and if a lead weight fell it could be fatal. Lastly, if the dirigible to moor at the Empire State Building it would be breaking an existing law. This law states that airships can not fly to low over urban areas, so it is clear that it is illegal to moor on the Empire State Building. Before this project was started the builders should have researched or accounted for all the obstacles they were going to face."	4	4		4

One major problem arose when they realized the force of holding the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. @NUM1). This meant builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before being able to begin construction on the mooring device. Once the mast and reconstruction work completed, builders realize that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. @NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. Attempts to moor became even moor difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. @NUM3). This shows how builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project caused builders to struggle with the building's structure, weather, and the owners' vision, before ultimately abandoning the mast."	3	2		3																					
16002	6	The obstacles the buliders had to go through was preety hard. It was hard because the building was so high up in the air. They needed special gear to do it. Al Smith had to wait for an answer before building the mast because it was dangerous. Over sixty thousand dollars had to be made to the building framwork. The other obsticals were to drop and let passengers on. Also to refull your dirigibles if you had one. And it was just to make the building bigger.	1	2		2

They did over @MONEY1 worth of framework to the building.Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which was impossible. First off the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent ever-changing winds were too much to control the ship in.

Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured.

16006	6	"In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time.

16007	6	"Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ship to even go near the building. But say a ship got tethered to the mooring mast, the back end of the ship would swivel around the mass due to constant shifting winds because of violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons but mainly because the weights would be hanging over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down the violent winds would push the ship into sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles load itself there would be too much stress being added to the buildings frame. The buildings steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flamable so the owners of the Empire state building realized how worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York.

Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas. After the construction of the mooring mast, it was soon realized that would never be used."	3	3		3

One of the greatest obstacles they had to face were the winds at the top of the building because the winds were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents. It also was'nt safe having the dirigibles weighed down with lead weights so it wont swivel around the mooring mast. Also sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frameworK. They were scared that weighing the ship down with lead weights would be dangerous because of all the people below in the city.

To do this they were going to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to dock Dirigibles. The builders were unaware of the obstacles to come. They were faced with many architectural, @CAPS1 and nature based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized they could not just place the mast on top. The wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the dirigible being held by one cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down to the foundation. (paragraph @NUM1) To do this it would cost over @NUM2$ to make the frame work strong enough to hold the stress. Another obstacle that came into play was @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION2 hydrogen is used to fuel the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable so if anything ever happened over downtown New York. It would be a catastrophe. The greatest obstacle was said to be nature itself. The violent air currents are unpredictible and the dirigible would be shifting around even if weighted down. But it is not practical or safe to weigh the balloon dow with pedestrians below. Overall the outcome of the mast was a fail due to the blindly seen and the blindly predicted obstacles of nature, architecture @CAPS1."	4	4		4

Also, the thousand plus pound craft would add stress to the building's frame; so the frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the @LOCATION2. -(Which would cost over @MONEY1) the Idea proved to be unsafe when the German dirigible blew up at a @ORGANIZATION1 - they realized how dangerous that could be above densely populated area like New York City."	2	2		2																					
16042	6	"Based on the excerpt to The Mooring Mast, the builders who constructed the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building.

If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would swivel around & around the mooring mast, as said in paragraph @NUM1. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammible. as you can see there are quite a few of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on this building."	3	2		2																					
16043	6	"Based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.One of the reasons for the ideas failure was the fact that there was already a law in place making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the area, as it states in paragraph @NUM1. Also, it could've of been an extreme fire hazard if a blimp had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proved in paragraph @NUM2, where it states, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" which caused the owners to realize, ""how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" On top of all this, weather proposed an even bigger problem. Violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast was ""neither practical nor safe."" I believe the most important reason that the idea failed was because technology was simply advancing beyond predictions. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."""	3	3		3

One obstacle was the fact that most diribles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey (paragraph @NUM1). It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the @LOCATION2. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless of lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped."	4	4		4																					
16046	6	"Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety."	1	1		1																					
16047	6	"The obstacles that the builder faced is making sure that the building was stable enough. The architects knew that they could not just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said that the mooring mask was on a okay level and how they were working on things. A set of engineers are working finding a workable and faster arrangements. While, the government is trying to find out a safe way for the mooring airships to mast. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame (@NUM1). The obstacles that the builders went through was if a big dirigible was to go on top of the building it was add stress by weighing it down. Also, it would get to the point where it would reach the frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building the winds cause violent shifting out to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good. The builder of the Empire State building faced many significant challenges to allow the dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
16048	6	"The Empire State Building was always very famous and well-known, but did want more attention. Governor of New York, Al Smith, tried to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. He was encouraged it would work and actually went through with building it. The builders went through many obstacles trying to make it possible.To make this dream possible the builders would have to modify and strengthen the building. This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top. Unfortunately, nobody considered all the dangers of docking dirigibles. All the builders work never went through. They tried to dock two but it did not work out. The building turned into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers."	1	2		1																					
16049	6	"When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects experienced many obstacles. These obstacles lead the designers to never effectively use the mooring mast like they had hoped to. The first problem they had, was that a thousand ton dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. The designers had to spend @MONEY1 to reinforce the building's frameworks. This first obstacle already put doubt into the builders minds, that this was not going to happen easily. The next thing they realized, was that with hydrogen dirigibles is that they were extremely flamable. If a huge dirigible were to catch fire and fall onto New York City it would be cataustrophic. This also leasoned their enthusiasm about the work, knowing about how great a risk this would be. The wind above the building were constantly Shifting due to air currents, and this would toss and turn the dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers relized this would be neither practical or safe being over pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle of all, that really killed their mooring idea, was airship laws. The law states that the dirigibles cannot fly that low over urban areas, so that puts an illegal mark on their plans. The designers of the mooring mast had to face many obstacles in their design, and it was these obstacles that led to the never useing of their mast."	3	4		4																					
16050	6	"There were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles.  One of these obstacles they faced was height, and the lack of safety that arose from it.  In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which use a highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen.  Should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about about their day.  The largest obstacle they faced though was nature.  Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only teathered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street.""  As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor say if.  The third obstacle they faced with a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas.  Even as tall as the Empire State Building is, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast.  Al Smith's idea finally had to be abandoned due to safety, nature, and state law."	3	4		4																					
16051	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the weight of the dirigible ""or blimp"", lust wind pressure, caused too much stress on the building's frame. The architects easily overcame this obstacle. They strengthened to iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem a safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature was also an enormous obstacle. Wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down. Finally, there was an existing law stating aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas."	3	4		4

""flying to low over urban areas"" was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps that were being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. Ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it would be terrible if one fell. It should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not going to work."	4	3		4																					
16054	6	"On the excerpt there were a lot of obstacles on the atempt of Building the Empire State Building and making it safe to dock dirigibles.

Second the men made a shiny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower, illuminated inside. next they had to add four wings or shiny aluminum to rise a conical roof for housing the mooring arm.  Fourth the crew has to add stairs and elevators to accomidate the ""blimps"" passengers.  And lastly they would add a couple of observation rooms to the @NUM1 and 102 floors.

One obstacle they faced was S keeping a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area. All of these obstacles could not be overcome so in the end the mooring mast was not successful."	3	3		3

Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Then they, ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at it's corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms"". The roof had to be completed before the mask can take place. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself.

16058	6	"It is within our obligations as human beings to have dreams and want to convert them into reality. Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the empire state building is one I'd consider to be rather erratic. There were many obstacles that proved from early on, the fate of this project was failure.       It is apparent from very early into the constructions that this was surreal because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (paragraph 6). Having dirigibles cruising through a large city should have been perceivably impossible to Al Smith, even before the construction of the building occurred.     Safety was also something to be seriously taken into consideration since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" which also intertwined with the laws of objects flying too low over an urban area (paragraph @NUM1)."	2	2		2																					
16059	6	The firsts obstacles was to make the Empire State building the worlds tallest building by adding a top or a hat to make the building a little more taller. And second obstacle was to drop people from the mooring mast to the Empire State building's flat roof.	1	1		1																					
16060	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were quite aparent. One obstacle was that of nature, winds atop the building were at high speeds and always changing, this would make the dirigible unstable and difficult to dock. Another obstacle they faced was that of the passangers and bystanders safety. The dirigible could become uncontrollable putting many lives in danger. The last obstacle the builders faced was that of a law against flying airships too low over urban areas, it would make it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State building. The many obstacles that the builders faced blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State building."	2	2		2																					
16061	6	"The obstacles the builders would have to face would be things such as structural @CAPS1, and worrying about future technological advances. Even if they found out how to land a dirigible on the platform, what about advances on them or new transportation methods.

16062	6	"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable, would cause stress for the building's frame to be stressed. Due to this the builders had to modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating.One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" Winds at the top were constantly changing. The back of the ship would move around  the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields the back of a dirigible would be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed."	3	3		3																					
16063	6	The first obstical came when the @PERSON1 builing had changed its height. They created the mooring mast and made the empire state builbing @NUM1 ft. higher. Then they figured out that the mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Then with the new laws and the hindenburg that the mooring mast would not work-out. So the gave up trying to make it useful.	1	1		1																					
16064	6	"First, there was no way to anchor any dirigibles. They couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street. Second, there were laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building. All in all it was a bad idea."	2	3		3																					
16065	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that was faced was the buildings foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted, nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This became an obstacle because the building had already been built, so they'd have to work around the existing foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was a law. The law stated ""no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas."" This became an obstacle because they had to convince government people it was safe. Finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was an obstacle because winds could get so bad that the dirigible tied up could rip the roof off and hurt the people below. In conclusion, that is how the builders in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
16066	6	"The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The fist one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduse the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars' went into modifications of the building's framework.Another problem was the dirigibles themselfs. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people."	2	3		3																					
16067	6	"When constructing the mooring mast on top of the empire state building it seemed as if the engineers looked past all of its flaws. Safety was probaly one of the biggest issue for the mooring mast. It was said most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen of helium. Thus causing a higher risk to explode. After the events of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they were very afraid what would happen if it occured above downtown Nature was belived to be its biggest obstacle. Winds at the top of the air awalys shifted violently due to air currents. The back of the ships would swivel around and around the mooring mast @CAPS1 were another major reason. Dirigibles were not allowed to fly a certain height over Urban areas. Making it illegal to even approach the area where the building was. Al Smith really should have done some more studying about what could have gone wrong with his mooring mast."	3	3		3																					
16068	6	"The builders of the Empire state Building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. First off, a dirigible moored to the mast by just one cable would put enormous stress to the frame of the building The building's frame had to be strengthened first to allow such a project. When the mast was finished, several other problems prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of helium. Earlier, the German blimp Hindenburg had been destroyed because hydrogen was so flammable. It was realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic should it happen over a densely populated city like New York. Also, blimps moored to the mast would be blown around by violent winds, possibly pushing them into nearby buildings. The lead weights normally used to prevent this would have had to be left dangling over pedestrians, a major safety issue- @CAPS1, there was a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban settlements, making use of the mast illegal. These problems doomed the mooring mast project from the start."	4	4		4																					
16069	6	"The fact that these dirigibles are so big and filled with hydrogen and helium the point at the top would have poped it. Also the Winds were always too high so they would never be able to connect the blimp to the building. Lastly the fact that the German dirigible, Hindenburg burned like that they were afraid for that to happen. Especially in a crowded area such as New York."	2	2		2																					
16070	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many problems when attempting to make a mooring mast for Dirigibles.

A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians.Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings."	3	3		3																					
16072	6	"Architects and builders working on building a docking platform on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. The first problem builders came across was the possibility that the building's framework was not potentially strong enough to support a dirigible's weight. It was said in paragraph nine that ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, and that was too risky. Another obstacle that builder's came across ""was nature itself."" @CAPS1 some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, it was feared that the winds on top of the building would be too intensely violent and be destroyed by flammable gas. The next obstacle builders faced was public safety. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 dirigibles could not approach the dock over the area for sake of the citizens of New York. All of these problems eventually led to ""the idea of using the mooring mast [to be] shelved."""	3	3		3																					
16073	6	"After reading excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, the lack of a suitable landing area. The builders knew they had to add a mooring mast to the top of it so it could safely land and passengers could board and exit off. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would at stress to the buildings frame. This pressure along with the wind pressure would have to be converted all the way to the buildings foundation. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, allowing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Although was a bright idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out properly."	2	3		3																					
16074	6	"Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen a highly flamable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This raises safety issues for the urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to violent winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction."	3	2		3																					
16075	6	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock."	3	3		3																					
16076	6	"In the excerpt the obstacles the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"". (p. @NUM1) @CAPS1 were trying to attempt a suitable landing area to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on. @CAPS1 try to attempt an electric winch. This ""would swing in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking gangplank to an open observation platform."" The biggest obstacle, @CAPS1 of the Empire State building was to ""nature itself"" which meant that dirigibles moored in open landing fields, where they would be high above pedestrians on the street where it was neither practical nor safe. @CAPS1 of the Empire State attempted these causes to allow dirigibles to enter on the property of the Empire State Building!"	2	3		3																					
16077	6	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The safety of the people were at stake, nature was also a great obstacle, the other reason was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it was against the law.First of all, the builders obstacle that they completely forgot about was the safety of the people. Most of the blimps from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen other than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. And they did not want to risk anyone getting hurt in a densely populated area. Also, another big obstacle was @CAPS1 nature itself. At times the winds would be violent and it would go back and forth. And if a blimp was attached, it would be dangling violently over citizens had not nearly safe. Lastly, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas and New York was highly dense. And the reason for this law is for nothing bad to happen to the citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles the builders had gone through, and they were blinded by the project and they wanted to get it done they forgot about safety."	3	4		4																					
16078	6	There would have been multiple obstacles when allowing a dirigibles to dock a the top of the empire state building. One it may get very densely populated with taller buildings.

16079	6	"While building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. They would need to find a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast with out having it swing in the wind. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM1). Another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building was designing the mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM2). The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be strengthened in order to withstand to weight of the mast."	2	2		3																					
16080	6	"The builders of the empire State building faced many obstacles in the making of the mast. The first obstacle was that of the buildings stability. The excerpt states ""The steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened"". This shows that in order for the mast to even be built the structure of the entire building would need to be altered to accomidate the use of the mast. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual use of the mast, was nature. In hopes of docking the dirigibles to the mast, mother nature would not allow it, as it @CAPS1 in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They also warned that with those air currents the passengers would not make it off of th dirigible safely due to the end of the dirigible floating rapidly undocked. They feared that if they docked the end it would be unsafe to the pedestrians below just as the helium in the dirigible would of as well."	3	3		3																					
16081	6	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, until finally they called it quits. According to the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Chrysler building in New York City was about to be the height of the not-built Empire state. The weight and strength of a dirigible could damage the entire building so it would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the blimp to be able to land. The engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability that dirigibles tend to have. In paragraph @NUM1, Lüsted describes a dirigible that exploded in New Jersey not long ago, and that constructing a landing pad over the densely populated New York City, could be detrimental. The constructors of the mooring mast finally came to the conclusion that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM2). The blimps are held down with lead weights and this could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to ever go wrong. The builders of the Empire State building had a lot to think about in regards to constructing the dirigible dock, and in the end, it was for the better that they decided against it."	3	3		3																					
16082	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, explains how the spire of the Empire State Building was originally meant to be used as a mooring mast. This purpose of the spire was never to be fulfilled because of the numerous problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the biggest problems that the builders faced were unpredictable and violent winds, the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, and air laws. The winds posed to be a problem because even though the front of the dirigible would be tethered to the mast belonged back side would be allowed to swing freely in the wind which could cause it to crash into another moored dirigible. The winds also would make just getting to the Empire a hazardous job. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous over a densely populated area. Lastly, the air laws were a problem because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal."	4	3		4																					
16083	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents, and existing laws, in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The first obstacle the builders had encountered was the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles outside the United States. Hydrogen is considered highly flammable, a big safety issue. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as down town New York.""

16084	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there was that the stress of the dirigables load and wind pressure could have caused problems to the buildings foundation. A thousand-foot dirigble, held by a single cable tether. would add stress to the buildings frame.Safety was another issue, most dirigbles outside the United States used hydrogen, instead of helium. This is a problem because hydro gen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigble Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. the accident would have been more dangerous in New York because the city is densely populated.Another reason why they faced problems to allow dirigables to dock is because there was an existing law against airships flying too close over urban areas. In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigble did attempt to reach the mooring mast but could not reach because of the winds, fearing that it may blow the dirigble onto sharp spires of other buildings. This would puncture the dirigbles shell."	3	4		4																					
16085	6	"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" @CAPS1, the builders were over to overcome this problem. After the building however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for it's full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a density populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe.""

In order for this to happen the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be strengthened and modified. The next obstacle they faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For example, in the excerpt it said that the U.S. navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also the captain could not even take his hands off the lever. The next obstacle they faced was the safety issue.

Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable.

They thought about when the German dirigible crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another issue being nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was always aggresively shifting. Plus using lead weights like they do when landing in the fields would be hazard for the people below.

Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building was never thought of an easy task to accomplish. As it was mentioned in the article the idea of the dirigible was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" One obstacle in which builders would face is safety. Since most of the dirigibles from outside U.S.A uses hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. This is a very dangerous obstacle to builders because fire itself is really dangerous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, however. If the winds are shifting violently, the dirigibles could be way down and be dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe to the people or the builders because it could hurt them. Another obstacle builders would face is that there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. It would make illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area.

Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be highley dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast with winds like that.

16093	6	"The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State building.  One of those major obstacles was the frame work.  When your going to build a 1,250 foot building and have a air craft land on it, you need a good and well designed frame.  What they did was add a stainless steal and chrome-nickle windows to cut down on pressure.  They spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State building.  The other main issue was the air currents.  You can not strapp a dirigible and believe the back of it swaying back and worth.  When your almost a 11 @NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height.  If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, the dirigible would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrian on the ground below.

Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars.The most obvious problem was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen.

Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question.

However in trying to do this the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, & this is where the first obstacle they faced comes into play.

This would be another obstacle the workers encountered. The mooring mask was destined to never fulfill its purpose, do to the safety of many people. This was yet another obstacle the workers faced.

The architects then had to find a way to add ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" without adding stress to the buildings frame. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was the nature itself"". Architects knew that they could not control the weather, and this worried them. Another obsticle the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". If dirigibles were able to reach the building something could go wrong. Builders ""feared that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"". The obsticles the builders faced soon became pointless when ""the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared""."	3	4		4																					
16108	6	"In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building the works set themselves a hard task. First they had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications so that the building would withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible. Also, a prexisting law made it immpossible for dirigibles to come as low to the city as they needed to be to dock. Finally constant changes in wind current and other weather made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible because the dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buidings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling over pedestrians."	3	2		3																					
16109	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended to late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 much, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize."	2	4		3																					
16110	6	"The obstacles of The @CAPS1 of Them Empire state building were some big ones which led to some Problems. for @CAPS2, There was a lack of a, Landing area for the Dirigible. But the @CAPS3 reason was the lack of saftey there for This dream could Not be accomplished."	2	1		2																					
16111	6	"Based on the exerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."	2	2		2																					
16112	6	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail."	3	2		3

16114	6	"While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930's. Many workers and financial men and women faced problems when trying to dock dirigibles. A dirigible was a live propeller that passengers who boarded the dirigible could ride. It was a closed compartment under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions. Dirigibles were a dangerous device from what the passage says. From outside the United states they used hydrogen, not helium. The cause affect in using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible... named Hindenburg, exploded by the cause of fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles was a very dangerous device back used in the 1930's. So then by the late 1930's, the idea of wing transportational diribles faded away. Later on they took passengers baggage of dirigible and made it into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden."	1	1		1																					
16115	6	"The obstacles the builder's of the Empire state Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was safety, nature itself and the law.Safety because dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable and accident could happen like ""German dirigible Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.""nature being the second problem because violent air currents could shift the dirigible and cause damage and hurt pedestrians.Law being the last reason because there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. The statement in the excerpt says ""This law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building."" Which makes it quite pointless to have even built it in the first place."	3	3		3																					
16116	6	"In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, we learn about how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually meant to be a landing spot for dirigibles. However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because they were mostly made of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since the dirigible would possibly catch fire about New York City. Next, there was the problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent and the back of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around. Using lead weights to hold it down were a possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, though they should've seen them coming, in trying to get dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
16117	6	"Construction always has challenges. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to land dirigibles there. Some of the obstacles the builders faced included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the frame would need to be modified, the cost, and nature itself.landing the dirigibles would be a hard task. For one, the dirigibles are enormous, they are ""a thousand-foot"" long flying devices. This would make it extremely difficult to land just because of its weight. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way  to the building's foundation."" This is a struggle because the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified."" This modification would take lots of effort and planning. Plus, modification also brings up the problem of cost. There would have to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" That cost is mindblowing and would create challenges of how to get that money. In addition nature itself was an obstacle. Winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Nature would bring up many challenges for the builders to have to work around. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3		4																					
16118	6	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, talks about the height of the buildings, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architecture who built the Chrysler Building was secretly hiding something. The secret was that he constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, it shocked many people and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building. Now it's a height of 1,046 feet, which is 46 feet taller than the height of the Empire State Building. One obstacle to their expand use in New York city was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought that a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers on and off. The mooring mast couldn't just simply drop a mooring mast on top or the building. Adding a mooring mast to a cable tether could add stress to the buildings frame. They finally build the mooring mast and they raised the American flag again."	1	2		2																					
16119	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was an issue for the builders. The dirigibles made outside of the United States were used with hydrogen. This became a safety issue because ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". On top of the building, the wind is always shifting because of ""violent air currents"". The shifting winds would be a problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low of urban areas""; making it illegal to dock the dirigibles. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing danger to the city. There are many obstacles the builders faced that made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
16120	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians."	3	3		3																					
16121	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" @CAPS1 obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around.Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety was a major obstacle because dirigibles from outside the @PERSON1 used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came and played. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The idea was never successful due to the obstacles presented."	3	2		3																					
16122	6	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it whould add alot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York alot of innocent lives will be gone."	3	3		3																					
16123	6	"The builders faced many different obstacles in their attempt to allowing Blimps to dock there. There were two major obstacles. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly @CAPS1"" (@NUM1). If a blimp had an accident like the Hindenburg, not only would the Empire State building go down, it would affect other buildings and people too because of the city's population. Lastly the other large effect on the building was the weather. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2). The winds could have easily knock it over with a blimp attatched to it for this reason: ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2). As result to this the blimb would be so close to the mast that if a strong enoungh wind was blowing, the blimps weight you take the mast with it. All in all weather and hydrogen blimps with the builders' two major obstacles."	3	3		3																					
16124	6	"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plaussible in theory, but as it was put in motion the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame. The whole building had to be strengthed to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights the control the back of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of natures problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 used a more flammable gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countrie's blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over and urban area. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equipp [the building] for an age of transportation,"" had to be given up."	4	4		4																					
16125	6	The problems that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the issues of safety. As said in paragraph @NUM1 the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

16126	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, would be things such as the different usage of air. A sentence I found to follow this reason would be in paragraph @NUM1 when said, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would cause many problems and face many obstacles. Another reasoning I found was wind. A reason I found would be as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This would be something difficult to fix. As other obstacles I found such as the size and density, I find these two to be the best reasoning."	2	2		2																					
16127	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast.

Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flamable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densley populated area, downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast.

16132	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced like the amount of stress that the dirigibles would add to the frame of the building. safety issues and laws, and the winds around the mast. Any dirigible would add on tremendous stress to the already constructed frame of the building and builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still prevailed. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it virtually impossible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it also wasn't even an option to weigh down dirigibles for landing. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought about before construction started. The builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to outdo the expectations of all and do something as ""a higher calling."""	3	4		4																					
16133	6	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed."	3	3		3																					
16134	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	3		3																					
16135	6	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast it's self. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with it's original design. So the building had to be Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chrome-nickel Stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors . I got all this information from paragraphs @NUM2.	1	2		2																					
16136	6	"Based on the excerpt some obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws @CAPS1 plane height, the fact that some dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium, and lastly at such great heights the strong wind currents were a problem as well. The restriction of plane height was that plaes could not fly to low above cities without being a safety hazard. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". (The MOORING MAST). Another obstacle related to the fact that some outside the U.S dirigibles used hydrogen fuel in place of helium which could cause a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"". (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an obstacle as well, the high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as the attempted to dock at the Empire State Building which would pose as a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4																					
16137	6	There was many obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One was the weight. The architects could not just place the mooring mast or it would rush the building. So they had to add over sixty thousands of dollars into the framework. Another problem was safty issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles gass. Hydrogen is highly flameable so that catching on fire above New York was dangerous. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway in the back due to harsh weather so geting pasengers on and off board would be extremly dangerous to them. Also there is a law in New York prohibiting low flying vehecales so the dirigibles could not had dock their in the first place.	3	3		3																					
16138	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges ranged from nature itself to laws against it. They didn't take into consideration the constantly shifting air atop the building. At such heights as the moring mast violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. This was also due to the fact that the blimp would only be tethered in the front. Not only were those large factors coming into play but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State. They didn't think about the existing law. It stated that air ships flying to low or over urban areas was against the law. So many factors came into play with building such a project. Overall it was too far fetch of an idea.	2	3		3																					
16139	6	"There were a few obstacals to making this idea work. one of the obstacals was to make the mast and the frame of the building strong enough to support a dirigible swaying in the wind.

16140	6	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face."	3	4		4

In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many.

16142	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there work, there wasn't enough room, they weren't supposed to have aircraft near the city."	1	1		1																					
16143	6	"Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; a dirigibles dangleing nearly @NUM1 feet above ground with the possibility of explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible-held on by only a single cable-would put on the buildings frame. With the wind blowing the dirigible around the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about @NUM1 feet down. In order for this to work the builders would have to strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around once it was docked, as well as running the risk of being blown of course and into another building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place they should have checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. Builders of this landing dock and the empire state building just faced too many obstacles."	4	3		4																					
16144	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mostly due to the dangers of violent winds at such an altitude that may cause the aircraft to crash either into the building or down to the ground. For example two blimps attempted the docking and one of them could not come close to the building because of winds. The other was able to deliver a bundle of newspapers hoisted down by a rope. In conclusion, the main problem was the unstability of the aircraft being docked."	1	2		2																					
16145	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. One of the obstacles they faced was safety, because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen.

""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (¶ @NUM2). This would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM3).

16147	6	"The builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles.  One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible"	1	2		2

This was an issue because if the dirigible would catch fire or explode over it highly populated city like New York, many people would be put at risk of being injured or killed. The second issue the builders had to face was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These winds would cause the airship to swivel, even when tethered to the mooring mast, making it impossible to board. This would also be dangerous for anyone aboard the airship. The third issue was that there ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With New York City certainly being an urban area this law made it impossible for airships to even approach the Empire State Building to moor. Overall, there were many obstacles faced by builders in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these reasons, the Empire State Building was never an effective place for dirigibles to dock."	4	4		4																					
16150	6	"Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building, brought up many challenges for the builders. There was a huge saftey issue having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flamable gas and if they blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe."	3	3		3

By adding a comma ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the buildings frame would be under much stress; ultimately making the structure unsafe. To alter the frame and wind pressure, over @MONEY1 would need to be accumulated. If an accident were to take place, like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger.

The largest problem was a matter of safety.

The building would have to be modified costing over sixty thousand dollars more.Another obstacle faced was the gas inside the dirigible. Some used hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast.""The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building.""

16157	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders ""main obstacle were the wind currents the dirigibles had to face in trying to dock nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The harsh winds at the top of the building were constantly changing because of the air currents. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even get close enough to tie up to the mast. ""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" (Lüsted @NUM1) in fear the outer shell would be punctured by the mast. Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would moving all around the mast based on the unpredictable air currents. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted @NUM2). Therefore, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building was very unsafe, as the obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome."	3	2		3																					
16158	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it to dangerouse to the public. In conclusion The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock."	3	3		3																					
16159	6	"There were obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Another obstacle would be on paragraph @NUM1 where it says ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature itself would be another obstacle for the dirigibles, because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 but not least, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Which means it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even go near the area. In conclusion these were some out of the many obstacles a dirigible had to face."	4	3		4																					
16160	6	"the builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point It was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work. And dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived."	4	3		4																					
16161	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
16162	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time. Were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. With the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying to low over urban areas. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream."	3	3		3																					
16163	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem was designing the building to be able to withstand the stress from a thousand-foot dirigible swinging around it in the wind. The builders needed to find a way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation. Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, it kept being tossed about by the strong winds, this problem was never solved. A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch. A final problem was the fact that the dirigibles were so dangerous, and couldnt safly dock, as well as a law that prevented dirigibles from flying close to buildings, which was created for that reason."	3	3		3																					
16164	6	"During this time period, dirigibles were seen as the transportation of the future, and everybody thought that this was plausible. There were problems, however, that nobody saw through. For example, the dirigibles were seen to be the next big thing in transportation, but there was no evidence to support this. They spent all of their time, effort, and resources to construct something for a purpose that never worked. There were other problems that were overlooked as well, such as the wind speed at that height, and even if they could get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be too hard for one person. As the excerpt shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this problem too quickly and with insufficient information."	2	1		2																					
16165	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, two architects play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, competing for most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature. The winds caused the mast's to be clanging above human beings, which was not practical or safe."	2	2		2																					
16166	6	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue."	3	3		3																					
16167	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was they weren't sure if the structure of the building could hold up to a swaying dirigible. As said in paragraph @NUM1. Also the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast. As said in paragraph @NUM2.  There also was a law enforcement against airships flying too lower over urban areas. That would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with"	2	3		3																					
16168	6	"The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1-foot tall spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this first obstace in building the tower, Smith decided to change the idea for the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had made it to the world's tallest building."	2	2		2																					
16169	6	"Throughout the process of construction the Empire State Building contractors faced couple of obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it. First off, safety was a huge factor of the quest. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 a baloon and dirigible may have the same appearance the two are completely structured differently. Helium causes a balloon to rise a dirigible uses hydrogen to fly which is highly flamable. Secondly there was already a law put into effect for air trafficking. ""... could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the shell."" If the dirigible was to ever get punctured it could collaps into the streets of New York causing mass destruction. Thus concluding a few of many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
16170	6	The emire state building faced alot of obstacles and challenges while it was being built. The builders built a rocket shaped mast so the dirigible could be housed in the shaft itself. Which also had elevators so people could go down to the lobby. The building would now be 102 floors. The glassed observation room would be on the 101st floor.	0	0		0																					
16171	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3		4																					
16172	6	"The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future. As it turns out, however, architect Al Smith bit off more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg put worry over the owners heads. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that (Hindenburg) accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approch the area"", The final and most problematic part of the mooring mast was actually revealed to be nature itself. As it turns out, the wind on top of the building were too violent and unpredictable. Even if the dirigible was tethered, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". Overall, it seems like this was a great idea gone bad."	3	3		3																					
16173	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph @NUM1 the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a  highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas, which is found in paragraph @NUM4. By a dirigible docking it would be directly breaking the law."	3	4		4																					
16174	6	"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped."	2	2		2

The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe.      The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building."	2	2		2

The Empire State Building was supposed to reach @NUM1 feet, being just inches taller than the Chrysler Building, when the architect who designed the @CAPS1 Building snuck up and stuck a 46 foot pole on top. Of course the Empire State Building had to be taller, so they set a new goal and reached 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. Al Smith, @CAPS2 of New York and Architect, decided that the Empire State Building needed a cherry on top, so he decided to put a mooring mast for zeppelins on top. This plan was destined for disaster: the foundation wasn't stable enough for zeppelins, they could easily be blown out of control and onto the sharp tip of the Building, and also, since  zeppelins had hydrogen in them, they could explode and fall onto the densely populated @LOCATION1.

The stress of the dirigible's load, and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications.

The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe.

There were @NUM1 major problems of why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were what was in the dirigbles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships.     Dirigbles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigbles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamible. This coud have resulted in terrible way if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densed.     Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people.     Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict than the dirigibles wouldnt be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city.     In, conclusion there were many obstacles that the archtects dont think about before constructing."	4	3		4

This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.

16189	6	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium which is highly flamable. The owners realized the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used."	3	3		3																					
16190	6	"The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the strength of the buildings frame, Nature, and certain laws against it. A big problem with building a landing for the dirigibles on the empire state building was the strength of the base. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""(paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to get past was the element of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire state building were always changing due to violent air currents. A dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the potential of wrapping around the mooring mast in the unpredictable winds. The workers could not trust the dirigibles to not fall off the mooring mast and risk the dirigible going right down where thousands of pedestrians were walking. The last obstacle that the workers had to get past was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (paragraph @NUM2). All of these obstacles proved to be too much for the workers to handle as the mooring mast on top of the empire State building was never created."	3	4		4

Many are familiar with its famous spire at its summit, but few actually know why it's there. The truth is that it was meant to be a mooring dock for dirigibles, or zeppelins, balloons lined with steel that were equipped with propellers for steering.          The sad truth is that it never happened. According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"", the environmental conditions as well as safety condition, were too poor to accommodate. Apprently, the wind currents at such a high altitude are fears, and if a blimp were to be tethered to the top, quite a great deal of strain would be placed on the building frame. This is time-consuming and costly to fix. Also, there would be no practical way to weigh down the baloon without the risk of the falling on civilians. Not only that, but having air ships that low over urban areas was illegal. In short, the whole idea was wishful thinking, because it couldn't have happened."	3	3		3

A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if this would have happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the accident would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their greatest obstacle, was the power of nature. Air currents were violent, so the winds were constantly shifting and this would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships to fly too low over urban areas, like New York. Seeing the obstacles they faced, the builders realized that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building just was not meant to be."	3	3		3																					
16194	6	"In ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia lusted builders who tried to make it possible for dirigibles or ""blimps"" to tie up to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building faced some problems they didn't account for. These were variations of blimps they didn't plan for, safety issues and also laws they would have to violate to have a dirigible land. The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to dock on the building.Having not considered all these things the builders put up the mast but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, safety issues and legal troubles they didn't account for."	3	4		4																					
16195	6	"The Empire State building was built to compete with the Chrysler building and to compete they created a mooring mast.

16197	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought."	3	3		3																					
16198	6	"The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, drove him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task which lay ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects knew they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced with how to adjust the frame of the building to support the docking site. The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1). They were able to overcome this obstacle but many more loomed up ahead. The wind and weather needed to be taken into consideration as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" (par. @NUM2). Reluctantly the builders admitted to the inevitable obstacle posed by nature. The builders seems to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densley populated city was an all around dangerous idea. It was noticed that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @NUM3) and a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM4).

Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing.

At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft's flying that low. It was actually consitered illigal to dock the blimp there because it would have to be flying low enough to approach the building. Due to these factors, the Empire State Building was unable to become a dock to support blimps."	3	3		3																					
16223	6	"From my reading, I understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock atop such a structure as the Empire state building were numerous. an obvious one was structural stability throughout the entire building. Paraphrased from the passage, the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause stress on the building's frame. another was controll of the dirigible during docking. The passage explained that the winds above the empire state building would shift violently and frequently. Safety as well as an issue, especially after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, when a German zeplin caught fire and exploded. "	2	3		3

Dirigibles were trying to figure out how to dock to the building yet most dirigibles failed. A law the dirigibles were unable to dock on urban areas in case of a problem within the dirigibles.

This in turn means that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the Empire State Building in order for it to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles.

For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down.

Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Since the dirigible was @CAPS1 big it couldn't get close enough because of sharp objects on other buildings.It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building."	3	3		3

One obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building. The issue was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. To fix this problem, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature. The winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions. This hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a problem. The final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the Empire State Building. The excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders."	4	3		4																					
16261	6	"During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand-foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Over sixty thousand dollars work of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel framed  balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realzed how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there."	3	2		3

Also with wind pressure the building's foundation would be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. As nature as a great affect on the use of the mooring mast it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. The wind would send the dirigibles swiveling around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen.      Other obstacles the builders faced were most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps would lead weight (which wouldn't be safe to have dangling over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law againts airships flying low over urban areas.

This is because when you have a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building, only by which is held by a single cable tether, it adds stress to the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was safety. Seeing as most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to go with. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a fire caution because it is extremely flamable. So safety was definitely another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, on repeat because violent currents would constantly shifting the winds on the top of the building.

If a dirigible was to catch on fire, then the whole Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone in it. It also wasn't safe because strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, causing danger to pedestrians below. One other obstacle that the builders faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

There were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town New York City would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (para @NUM1).

Lüsted says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire state building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was peoples safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

Another problem was that most of the @ORGANIZATION2's dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flamable. So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3. Also fears of the sharp edges and forceful winds would cause the dirigible to get punctured and pop."	3	4		4																					
16301	6	"During the @DATE1's Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle that the Dirigibles would face in landing in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. Another obstacle the architects and empire state builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the Dirigible to dock to the building, and also allowing people in and out of vehicle. Architects knew that they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. ""An A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" so architects had to reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen the structure of the building.

At the time it would be the world's tallest building, but the builders faced obstacles with the more distinctive part; allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting do to violent air current. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivle around and the lead weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down below. Overall, the construction of the mast was difficult, and unfortunately is never to be used."	3	4		4

The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame."" They would need to spend over @MONEY1 in order to modify the building's framework. Another issue, ofcourse, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S., did not use helium. Instead, those limbs used hydrogen which is highly flamable and would have caused disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The excerpt also states that, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1, there was already a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, There fore, it would be illegal for a blimp to attach to or even go near the Empire State Building.

All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors.

All of these accommodations were made for the help of dirigibles docking on top of the Empire State building."	1	2		2																					
16307	6	"The designers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it's peak. ""The greatest reason was safety"" (para @NUM1). The dirigibles were dangerous. Strong winds could blow them in different directions, possibly hitting the building. And if there was a crash, the debris would rain upon New York City. Since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place. However above the city this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2). Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This would cause the docking to be illegal. For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State building faced challenges allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building."	3	3		3

Another example would be in paragraph @NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen insted of helium, which is extremely flammable. A last example would be in paragraph @NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building.

This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers go on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed full proof at the time but this new construction plan endured on many obstacles.The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the building's frame. Architects detected that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle which was modifying and strengthening the the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle.

Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay."	3	3		3																					
16340	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock dirigibles at their building were that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen over helium, the winds at the top of the building violently changed, and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas.First of all, foreign blimps using hydrogen are very dangerous due to the high risk that they will burst into flames. This only occurred to the builders when a German blimp Hindenburg caught on fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they ""realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident happened over New York City, many more lives would have been lost. More people would die, which would cause a bigger fiasco.Also, the winds above the building change constantly, which would make the blimp unstable. The article explains this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would be torture on the back of the ship. The front would be secured due to its tethering, but the back would be left free to sway and swing in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at a high risk of danger, making this idea impractical.Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, nevermind dock on it. The article tells this by saying, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect pedestrians and innocent bystanders, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate said law.In conclusion, the three obstacles stopping the use of the Empire State Building were the hydrogen gas used in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds making the craft swivel, and the law prohibiting aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas."	4	4		4																					
16341	6	"Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work."	3	3		3																					
16342	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some big obstacles. One obstacle was they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely. They had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely. Lastly they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast. These examples shows that the builders were faced with many obstacles when building the Empire State Building."	1	2		2

16346	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast. These obstacles and dangers suggest the mooring mast is a bad idea. Which the constructers later came to realize."	3	3		3

16350	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock there were three major obstacles: the wind, the structure, and the safety. The wind was the most obvious flaw in the landing dock because of the rough wind currents at the top of the building. Landing perfectly on the dock was one thing, but staying there was impossible because you would have been whipped around. ""[@ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles] feared that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings of the area, which would puncture the shell."" (paragraph @NUM1)The problem of structuring the mast to hold the balloon would also become a structural obstical because ""[they] couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM2) To get the structure sound enough to land a dirigible they would have to do sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework.Lastly, landing a huge metal balloon ontop of the largest skyscraper, over millions of citydwellers, even when they knew the balloons were highly flamable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast didn't work out. Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration."	3	3		3																					
16351	6	"The builders and the architects faced many issues in making this project of extending the Empire State Building to 1,250 feet height. Though they planned their steps into making the mooring mast on top was unrealistic. It was unrealistic because this was never done before on top of a building. Another obstacle they faced was safety of the passengers and in general, because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Another obstacle they faced was with the weather, because landing a dirigible on top of the building with fast winds due to the violent air currents was also dangerous for the people on the dirigibles and could've possibly hit other building by swiveling around in the air from the winds. The last obstacle the builders faced, was that their project was illegal, against the federal law because the dirigibles would be flying to close to urban areas such as New York City, so therefore be impossible to accomplish, as shown in paragraph @NUM1. In this paragraph it states ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.

In theory, the Mooring @ORGANIZATION3 would be constructed to dock drigibles. However, it was eventually revealed that a docking station on the Empire State building would never be possible. The reason Al Smith's dream could never prove to be reality is because Smith and the builders hit many obstacles. One obstacle faced with the construction of the @ORGANIZATION3 was the location. When a landing zone is 1,250 ft above ground level, it is extremely tough to test and complete a perfect landing zone, much tougher then if it was on ground level. Also, with location is the safety of having such high wind speeds at such an altitude. It is that the higher altitude @CAPS1 get the higher the air pressure and the ""violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) @CAPS1 will have, making a very unsafe environment. Next, another aspect of the location was the fact it was in densely populated New York City, if there were any mistakes a great number of casualties would be expected. Lastly, a large obstacle Smith and the builders faced was technology, in the @DATE1's and 1930's the amount of technology and engineering was certainly unparallel to the technology prevalent in today's society."	3	1		3																					
16353	6	"The obstacles, the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that Al Smith constructed 185 foot spire inside the building to make it taller.

The reasoning behind the law was because of a german dirigible accident in New Jersey. Lastly, and probably the simpilest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was too risky to even attempt landing.

The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to air currents. It was difficult for the dirigibles to dock. The ""four-blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."""	3	3		3																					
16358	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building came upon some problems when putting in the dock for dirigibles.

Smith wanted it larger and by extending it, it became more dangerous and difficult to allow docks up there. Another obstacle was the weather at the top of the building.

The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimb from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly.

In order for the building to be structurely sound, the frame was modified to withstand the added stress. Even with research and modifications, the docking system was never put in place.

16380	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible be supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas. The builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for dirigible docking."	2	2		2																					
16381	6	"When faced with the prospect of building the tallest building in the world, Al Smith refused to give up. In order to achieve his goal, he decided to build a Dirigible docking mast atop his new creation. But with this genius idea came obstacle after obstacle, preventing the idea from ever taking flight. One obstacle faced by Al Smith, and by far the greatest, was safety. Most non-American Dirigibles used hydrogen within their Dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The owners of the empire state building realized how bad it would have been if a fiery explosion happened ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". Another great obstacle was nature itself. ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it impossible for the Dirigible to be tethered without the back of ship swireling around the mooring mast."	3	2		3

""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City.     Nature causes lots of obstacles inlife, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivil around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe.     There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped.     Saftey, nature, and the law kept Al @CAPS1 dream from coming true.

16385	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. Lüsted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As Lüsted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field. The laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law makes docking a dirigible impossible in New York City. The construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required ""over @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications"" and a lot of time and planning. As Lüsted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose"". The obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were too great and too many. The laws, safety, construction, and nature of the time were too big a setback for this endeavor."	3	3		3																					
16386	6	"There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another Reason consists of law @CAPS1. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is defanitley not the City for this idea just because there is alot of people walking around the @CAPS2 and there is many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would @CAPS3 to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea @CAPS4 disappeared."	2	1		2																					
16387	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3		3																					
16388	6	"The main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were mainly safety and nature itself. safety was most important, and because they were aiming at having dirigibles land on top of the building, they needed to make sure it was completely safe In the reading it states that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flameable."" @CAPS1 it is flameable, the builders realized how much danger it could cause especially in a high populated area like New York City. Now besides safety, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. With having the mooring mask at a steep height on top of the Empire State Building came with many difficulties that revolved around the weather and atmosphere The winds on the top of the building were always shifting, which would make it hard to land dirigibles. Because of the unsustainable air currents, nothing could be done about the dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Due to the roughness of the wind and the unidealistic design of the dirigible, safety and nature were main obstacles in the creation of the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
16389	6	"Builders faced many problems with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control like hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building and therefore they wouldn't be able to dock."	2	2		2																					
16390	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck."	4	4		4																					
16391	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock"	4	4		4																					
16392	6	"The idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building seemed like a grand idea at the time of construction, but it had many obstacles to overcome The builders first had to make ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the buildings steel frame. this would reinforce the building against the pressure a dock dirigible would create. Adding a mooring mast would not be as simple as placing one atop the building. So the builders constructed a huge stainless steel enclosure to house passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality was soon found to be extremely low. Not to mention the fact builders were a thousand feet high. this idea presented many challenges."	1	2		2																					
16393	6	"The Empire State Building wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on top. To do this the would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook on to and refuel. They ran into a lot of problem right off the bat and kept running into them. The first problem, of many, was that they could not just plop a mast on the top because it would be to unstable and cause to much stress to the structure. To prevent that what they ended up doing was modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole costing over sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to equal out all of the wind pressure, they had to think of how to bring the dirigibles in, the answer was simple electrical winches. The next problem was safty, dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen and if that blew up it would not be good for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds and to solve the problem on the ground they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from sweying, but doing that in the air over a lot of people could be unsafe. The final nail in the coffin to this plan was that there is a law for bidding airships to fly too low over urban areas."	3	4		4																					
16394	6	"The obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the winds on top of the Empire State Building. This is because in paragraph @NUM1 it states that ""the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This promblem would make the dirigibles Swivel around in the air. Another obstacle is that the dirigibles had is that it uses hydrogen and Helium which is highly flammable."	2	2		2																					
16395	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced such as the high winds, and how they could dock the dirigibles when it is against the law to fly an aircraft to low near urban areas. one obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and high winds. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced is the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to ever dock at building because it was illegal for aircrafts to fly to low near urban areas and it would have been a long process to ever get the government to let them."	3	3		3																					
16396	6	"The builders faced so many obstacles to dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One of the greatest obstacle's was nature itself, like winds on top of the building was shifting due to dangerious air currents.

The next problem was that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is flammable, and after the fire of the Hindenburg, people realized how potentially dangerous this docking idea was. Another problem was the weather. High winds could cause problems when the dirigibles are trying to dock. To top off, this list of problems is the fact that there is a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, there were just too many obstacles for the builders to overcome, and the mooring mast was never successful."	3	4		4																					
16398	6	"The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were severe. The greatest and most important obstacle they faced was safety. If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire. Especially in a place as crowded as New York. This was another problem with landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building.                                                                                                                                                                  Another obstacle was the wind. A dirigible could not land unless it was weighted down with lead weights which also was not a bit safe for people walking freely in New York City. These problems are the reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building"	3	4		4																					
16399	6	"In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.One obstacle was because of safety reasons.

Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the winds on top of the building.The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law.

Then Al Smith had an idea that would make his building over @NUM1 taller than the Chrysler building. Al Smith decided he would add a to the building to serve as a mooring mast for derigibles.

""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with the experts..."" to make sure everything would be safe and in check.

After so much work and effort the mooring mast never got put to use because ""Dirigibles moored... at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	2	2		2																					
16403	6	"In building the Empire State Building, builders had to deal with numerous obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was what the dirigibles would attach to. Builders thought that by adding a mooring mast it would make docking easy, although they disregarded the building's foundation. The builders realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to accommodate dirigibles, so over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to make it stronger. Builders then had to brainstorm how passengers would board, along with a place for baggage and ticketing. To resolve this, a glassed-in observation area and open observation platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law for how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly went against this law and the idea for using the mast for docking. After failed attempts at docking the idea went away, and builders realized the plan would never work."	2	3		3																					
16404	6	"The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible @CAPS1 had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem of there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land. However there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving and would the move back of the dirigible around and around till eventuly the back of the dirigible would hit the building. The other flaw Was that most of the dirigibles was filled with a highly flamable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas and if the airships managed to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal."	3	3		3																					
16405	6	"While building the Empire State building, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The original problem was figuring out how to get the dirigible onto the building. After consulting with the Navy as well as meeting with the president of newly formed ""airship transport company."" After this they thought they were past the rough of it, but there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mass, they realised with the height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix this problems, and it cost over @MONEY1 to make these modifications. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt, of dirigibles to dock, to stop in its tracks. Many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team. It could be very dangerous, as some gases used in dirigibles are extremely flameable. Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock, at such high altitudes, with ""constantly shifting"" air currents. All of these problems were amplified because it was even more unsafe for these problems to exist in such a populated area. The build team was able to overcome some obstacles, but some caused too many potential problems to be fixed."	4	4		4

""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" @CAPS1, safety was a paramount reason as to why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there because of the highly flammable gas, Hydrogen that is used in most dirigibles. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS2, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.

16407	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic!

First they had to make sure the dirigible wouldn't tear down the framework of the building. Because the dirigible was so large and heavy the dirigible added with the wind would ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which was at the bottom. This had to be addressed, or the building would have been destroyed. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the buildings. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public.

Therefore, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Furthermore, anchoring a @NUM1 foot dirigible to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, the architects would have to make @MONEY1 in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent & unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot had to maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical & safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
16415	6	"Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the buildings flat roof. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building."	4	4		4																					
16416	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. For one, most drigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For instance, on May 6, 1937 the German drigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is no predicting that that could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting drigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and even if it was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Drigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets wasn't practical and not safe. Another reason is because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear over the wind, blowing the drigible in to other buildings in the area which would puncture the drigible's shell and cause a lot of damage."	3	4		4																					
16417	6	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 t buiders of the Empire State Building faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof. This is saying that you need to have a solid amount of support to hold a dirigible. Another is ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen not Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. So if that were to catch fire in the middle of New York City That would not be good. Another is the changing wind speeds would cause the dirigible to sway in the air. This could cause issues with stability. So in this passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 had to overcome obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
16418	6	"When something is getting invented or built, many obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety. The wind at the top of the empire state building was another problem. The actual building was a problem too. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them, and failed.Safety is important, if one person dies per trip nobody is going to go on the ballon. Safety is important, no safety means no bussiniss. The wind was a huge problem. If the balloon won't stay still while unloading it is very unsafe. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. Maybe one day they will fix it."	2	2		2																					
16419	6	"In The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the main problems was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which made it dangerous for dirigible to be turning around the building above pedestrians.Another obstacle that the builders raced was that the dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State building did not want a dirigible to catch fire above a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York.""The last obstacle faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."""	3	4		4																					
16420	6	"There were many problems the builders of the Empire state building faced when it came to dirigibles.They faced problems with ""... Violent air currents"" That flow above the building. These would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock, and sway the back end while they were docked. Another problem was that there was an ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State building. These obstacles described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Lüsted show why the spire at the top of the Empire State building was never used to dock dirigibles."	3	2		3																					
16421	6	"There were many obstacles that stood in the way of the of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because must dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact the dirigible would be relatively in close proximity with the pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast. In addition there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do just that if it attached to the mast. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast. The solution would be to put heavy blocks in the back that could cause it to fall on top of the pedestrians. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
16422	6	"The obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
16423	6	"The builders of the Empire State built two floors just for the passengers to drop off their luggage. They had a view in those floors, and was the idea didn't work, they wasted money on those extra rooms.They started working on the build and attempt to make dirigibles dock on the top, but they wasted alot of time and money, and it was just a waste altogether."	0	1		1																					
16424	6	"The Empire State Building was designed to become the world tallest buiding, with a few tricks up its sleave. The building was originally planned to also function as a Mooring mast for dirigibles. Unfortunately many problems lay in the way interning this theory into reality. One obstacle the constructors of the Empire State Building faced was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. ""Most Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. ""The use of hydrogen posed a dangerous threat to the safty of civilians in New York City. Another problem which was encountered with the building was the wind."" the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast... (the dirigibles) dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. A third problem the builders had was the leaglity of the issue of mooring ships the buildings. There was an existing law against air ships flying to low over urban areas. ""With this law in place it would have been impossible for ships to moor. Although the builders had good intentions, they failed to realize the reality of the situation."	3	3		3																					
16425	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The difficulty in having stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.      Wind was another obstacle that the builders had to overcome. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. And even if the dirigible were to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the led weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street."	3	3		3																					
16426	6	"Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quitely retired."	3	3		3																					
16427	6	"When the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles first @CAPS1 about it seemed like a brilliant idea But as time and construction went on, the surmounting obstacles that arose made the idea of a Mooring dock stayed just an idea. When the mooring mast was finished, the obvious safety hazards stopped it from fulfilling it purpose. The greatest @CAPS2 hazard was the nature of the mast itself. The Winds at that height were strong, violent and constantly Shifting. Even if the dirigible was tethered down, the back of the ship would be swireled around the mooring mast.Another hazard was that most dirigiples from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that they could not take that @CAPS3. A final obstacle that arose was a law that was against Airships flying too low over urban areas. this law made it illegal for a ship to even come near the building."	3	3		3

This means that any little spark inside the dirigible would send it up in flames. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents.' This proves that having the dirigible docked up there would be very dangerous and would call for weights to be used to anchor the back of the dirigible. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This symbolizes that it is against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area. The idea of docking dirigibles at the empire state building were ignored."	4	3		3

Nature forces were a total threat to the idea of the dirigibles landing on the Empire State building: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which wouldn't be safe for the people getting in and off the dirigible because the ship would swivel around and around the morning mast. Other oposition to the idea was that most dirigibles that came from outside the U.S didn't use helium, but hydrogen which is highly flamable and risked the life of the people who lived around the Empire State building. Also the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibet airships to fly too low over the urban areas. This law made the docking of the ships in the Empire State building illegal.

This shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the others practical reason why dirigibles could not moore at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add stress to the building's frame.

Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. According to the article, dirigibles could be weighted down to prevent this, but it is to unsafe for pedestrians. There was also the issue with docking dirigibles that use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In May 6, 1937, a hydrogen dirigible was destroyed by fire and according to the excerpt, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that if the accident was at downtown New York, it would have made the densely populated area to unsafe.

The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders."	4	4		4																					
16455	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Because Al Smith wanted to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. The building's frame had to be modified before the construction of the mooring mast could begin because just putting on top would stress the frame and bring it down. Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. There was even a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areasThe builders had to work their way around. The biggest obstacle seemed to be safety for the people.	3	3		3																					
16456	6	"In the process of building the empire state building the architects had many obstacles. One main obstacle was making the foundation strong enough. Another was the wind factor. They had many problems in the building of the Empire state building.In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire state Building they had to streghten, the whale foundation. If a dirigible docked before the whale building would twist and sway. Another problem was the wind. the wind coming off of other building would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed.Even though they faced many obstacles they successfully completed the Empire State Building"	2	2		2																					
16457	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to add a dirigible docking station at the top of the building. As it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind could cause a serious saftey hazard by spinning the back of the docked dirigible around. Also dirigibles are highly flammable. If an explosion such as the Hindenburg took place at the top of the Empire State Building it would have been catastrophic. Attempting to moor a dirigible at the top of the building was not only dangerous: It was illegal. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2)The fact that mooring a dirigible was illegal and extreemely dangerous, was not the only obstacle that builders faced. It was also a daunting task. Builders would have to learn new technologies for operating the system at the U.S. Naval Air Station. After researching, builders reliezed that they would have to strenghen the frame. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (paragraph @NUM3) The obstacles the builders faced, proved to be enough reason to never use the mooring."	4	4		4																					
16458	6	"In their attempts to try and build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got one and off of dirigibles. While anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to get on and off, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel which could endanger the passengers and could possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or destroyed. Another difficulty was the way the mast was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, so it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform-like design, so instead of hovering dirigibles could land, which allowed for more stability."	2	1		2																					
16459	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. The builders had to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment used in building mooring masts, land dirigibles service and a workable arrangement, and modify the building for support of the mast.In preparation to the construction of the mast the architects first took tours of the equipment at the @ORGANIZATION1. The builders also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered their services across the Pacific Ocean. A workable arrangement had to be created. It was difficult and tedious to figure, ""on some safe way of mooring ships to this mast."" The foundation of the building had to be considered as well because, ""the architects could not simply dropping mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Over @MONEY1 in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be performed. All of these were obstacles in the way of architects building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
16460	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the architects faced was the building's frame. They needed to design the landing area so that if a dirigible landed there, it wouldn't add too much stress to the building's frame. Another problem was the stress of the load, and wind pressure. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says ""The stress of dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred  feet below,"" and that is why the dirigible's load, and the wind's pressure are a significant problem. Finally, after the builders figured out that they needed to make various adjustments, also to strengthen the building's steel frame, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made,"" which is a lot of money! Those are the obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
16461	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (Lüsted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."	3	3		3																					
16462	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The @CAPS1 Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it was mentioned that architects faced challenges when attempting when allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building One obstical they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt it said that hydrogen is highly flammable @CAPS2 if something went wrong it could be a huge problem in a highly populated area like New York. The main problem they faced was the nature itall. It said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" The dirigible has the potential to swivle around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous. These challenges are what led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originaly planned"	3	3		3																					
16463	6	"It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the Mask which sounds like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammible and to dangerous to use in such a highly populated area. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction."	3	3		3																					
16464	6	"The first obstacle that the can builders faced was the fact that the idea of the empire State building being the tallest construct in New York City had been shattered. This led them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded. When the design to make the construct of the plan was complete they begin to face more potential problems. The first being it was not logical or probable to ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (line @NUM1) For, in dang this the amount of stress it would induce on to the frame would be monstrous, hence, it was concluded the stress would have to be transmitted through the building's foundation, which to the builders dismay was 11 hundred ft. below. This resulted in @MONEY1 worth of modifications to the foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was the wind pressure. ""Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close engough to tie up because of  forceful winds"" (line @NUM2)"	2	2		2																					
16465	6	"While constructing the Empire State Building the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. To begin, the dangers of allowing dirigibles that were made outside of the United States. May non-American dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is much more flammable compared to the United States helium balloons. To avoid a repeat of the explosion of a dirigible Lüsted states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above.. Downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the winds at the top of the building were to wild to attach a dirigible safely to the top. The author clarifies, ""Even if the dirigibles were thethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around... the back could be weighted down with lead weights, but using these was neither practical nor safe."" This shows that in order to have the ship still enough to be able to moor it was dangerous. Lastly, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the building to be able to moor. Marcia Amidon Lüsted says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This makes the possibility of landing a dirigibles on the Empire State Building illegal."	3	3		3																					
16466	6	"One of the obvious reasons is the height of all this taking place. The strong, always changing winds, the winds were a problem because it would make the back of the blimp sway from side to side. Another problem was trying to stop the swaying of the ship, they consulted putting lead weights, but hanging weights above pedestrians is not safe at all. Another reason was, it was against the law to fly aircrafts to low to the ground. These are just some of the reasons why this wasn't gonna to work."	3	2		3																					
16467	6	Even beginning to build the dock of the empire state building was A mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile And realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obsticle the builders faced in Attempt to Allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not Allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians. Another obstacle they fased where the unsafeness of it All. The winds A that height Are constantly different And could cause the Dirigibles to move Around. Having Airships dock at the empire state building was potentially dangerous As well As illegal.	2	2		2																					
16468	6	The builders of the empire State building faced alot of obstacles. One problem they had was when & if they landed getting an area for the people to get on and off. they had to make the platform bigger also. When the dirigibles landed it was because they needed more fuel @CAPS1 it would only be a couple hours they were stopped.	1	0		1																					
16469	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders experience many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the builders cannot just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable teather, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another problem the workers faced is they would have to change the entire design of the building to meet the accommodations of the mooring dock. The largest reason why the dock didn't work out was safety. The author writes ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" This means that the dirigibles are highly flameable and if one exploded over the densely packed New York it would have serious reprocusions. All of these reasons are why the mooring dock never came to life on top of the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
16470	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obsticles was that many dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (para. @NUM1). Docking dirigibles that use hydrogen not helium had been proven dangerous by the German Hindenburg when it was destroyed in a fire, and if anything like that occurred over New York the results would be horrible. A second obsticle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was another safety consern. The point was brought up that ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (para. @NUM2). This would make it unsafe for the passengers on board the dirigible.

Some of the problems faced was there is a law in the U.S. that doesnt let aircraft fly close to or around cities and buildings. This meant they wouldn't be able to have the blimps tethered to the mast anyway. The highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind also posed a problem because it would be blowing the blimp everywhere, and its could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land because it wouldn't be safe having them hang over the city. With the winds being crazy the blimp (most of them filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and set ablaze following towards the people on the ground.

The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon Lüsted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	4	3		4

Since the dock would be above downtown New York, there is a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were many winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea will drop.

The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks ""when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Also, another obstacle of placing a mooring mast among one of the world's tallest buildings was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

The idea of haveing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building caused the whole building to be modified. It costed over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obsticles like the modifications. Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise."	3	3		3

The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below.

16494	6	"Al Smith faced many obstacles in designing and building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. Most of the obstacles should have been realized before the mast was even built.One of the obvious obstacles was the constant change in wind. The back of the blimp would not be tied down therefore swinging around in the sky. Another, obstacle would be the design of the mast. This was important because if designed wrong the mast would put stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage. Their was also a law about airships flying too low in urban areas, New York being an urban area. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some blimps were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable.Al Smith and his architects should have realized and discussed these issues before constructing an unusable structure. If this was discussed a lot of time and money would have been saved."	3	3		3																					
16495	6	"In this excerpt The Mooring Mast by, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstical was to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, but they overcame that with the desion to add a top or a hat to the building. They then had to accomidate with the new situation that new modifications had to be done so that the dirigible would not add stress to the buildings frame, since the steel frame of the building could not with stand the load and wind pressure that would transmitt nearly @NUM1 feet below. The biggest obstacles that led to the fate of the mast was the fact of, since most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which was very flammable, and they could not have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle though because, of the constant shifing winds. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but with them dangling high above pedestrians on the street was not safe or practical. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the obsticals that builders faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building."	3	3		4																					
16496	6	"Marcia Amidon Lüsted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards."	3	3		3																					
16497	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by. Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Al Smith wanted to make the tallest building in New York. He had made the building very tall, 1,046 feet tall to be exact, but then, the Empire State Building was made taller, 1,250 feet. It was basically a competition to see who was to have the tallest building in New York. A mooring mast was put on top of each building for more height. Although, the builders did not account the balloons, or dirigibles that pass in the air. Dirigibles are highly flammable, and if they so happen come in contact with a mooring mast, it could be destroyed, just like before, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937,""... The mast could have caused huge chaos to New York if it did damage upon a dirigible passing in the air."	2	1		2																					
16498	6	The greatest reason was one of safty: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violen air currents	2	2		2																					
16499	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to just drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add stress to the building's frame. Though this was an obstacle, the architects spent over @MONEY1 on modifications to the frame to remedy the problem.Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became concerned that the same accident could occur over downtown @LOCATION1.In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be allowed to dangle over busy city streets. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban a city. This made it legal for all airships to tie up or ******** this area. Those were the obstacles facing the architects."	4	4		4																					
16500	6	"When building the dock for dirigibles. Al Smith was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were more obstecles than expected. One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles as stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violen shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast and to dang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence) along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM3, second sentence). The whole idea of a docking mast was not well thought out."	3	3		3																					
16501	6	"During the time of the @DATE1's many obstacles came into play to the architects building a dirigible dock for them to land on top of the Empire State building. The builders had to face situations with weather conditions of this dock. The Empire State building was so high ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The weather conditions that were occurring high above of this 1,250 ft building made it difficult for dirigibles to dock themselves making the outcome unsafe. Builders also had to face the reality of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". with this law taking its action it made it illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks. The main concern of obstacles these builders constructing this landing dock would be the strong winds that would occur. The winds were so powerfull and strong that the blimp would face ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" This obstacle of weather was a huge struggle to these architects making the dock of these dirigibles unsuccessful. The obstacles that were faced in constructed this dock came to the outcome of dirigibles being ""given away to airplanes""."	4	3		4																					
16502	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the one obstacle to thier expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, also saw a opportunity for his Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on. Also dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. In conclusion, these are the obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced, to allow dirigibles to be docked."	1	1		1																					
16503	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York was determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had goals where the building ""would be equipped For an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as an opportunity to have a a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there For several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Al Smith's ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was actually constructing the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Even though this was an obstacle, the modifications to the building had adjusted this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising which made the goas for Al Smith much farther away.Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety which was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left uncomplete because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5."	4	4		4

16505	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included issues in safety, nature problems, and a dilemma with a law. Safety was a major concern as many dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An example of such a dirigible was the German Hindenburg, which went up in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City."" @CAPS1, nature was a big obstacle the owners faced, as the winds on top of the building constantly shifted. According to Lüsted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" @CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, ""This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the Empire State Building faced issues with safety, nature, and the law."	4	3		4																					
16506	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 faced many problems with the attempt to allow blimps to dock their. One problem was that the already constructed frame was not strong enough for a new mooring mast for blimps. A second problem is shown in the quote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents..."" (Lüsted para. @NUM1). The weather at the height of the Empire State building would throw and move blimps in violent ways when trying to dock. The push of the winds even caused the threat of blimp being blown into a spire on a surrounding building, the threat is shown in the quote ""which would puncture the dirigibles shell"" (Lüsted para @NUM2). That is what could happen if a blimp tried to tether to the building. The builders also faced the laws about flying that low over an urban area. All in all the builders of the Empire state building did face a many problems while trying to allow blimps access to the building."	3	3		3																					
16507	6	"The builders of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was placing the mooring mast on the building. Lüsted states, ""The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof"" (Lüsted @NUM1). This meant that they would have to build another structure to be able to place the mooring mast. The second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles. Lüsted claims, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top... held by a single tether would add stress to the buildings frame (Lüsted @NUM1). The dirigibles would weigh the building down so they would have to find a way to prevent damaging the building. The architect would have ""The steelframe modified and strengthed"" in order for any dirigible to dock there. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock."	3	2		3																					
16508	6	"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""

16509	6	"There were many obsticles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First off, there was a great safety concern. Many dirigibles from foriegn countries used helium instead of hydrogen; while helium is very flamlable, therefore the dirigible might explode. Second, the wind made it very challenging to dock the dirigibles. The winds were always changing because the violent air currents. Finally, there was already a law in place against airships flying to low over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other problems it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles.

The risk of the dirigible being caught on fire was very high. If it did catch on fire not only would it harm the blimp, but also the buildings and people of New York. Another obstacle that was in the way was mother nature herself. No one could predict the weather, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2).

16529	6	"Based on excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were, to get it to work. For many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most places used to fuel there dirigibles made them highly flammable. In a highly populated areas such as New York this would be a problem.Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the building.Finally the last reason would be safety. Violent winds would make dirigibles unstable When docked to the building. There is also an existing law against airships flying too low over Urban areas.In @CAPS2 based on excerpt The Mooring Mast; by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were the flammability, money issues, and safety reasons."	4	4		4

The first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accomadate the @NUM1 ft dirigibles. Sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications. Another problem was safety. A lot of dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated New York a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. Since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it.

The winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted a lot to do to the violent air currents, even if the Dirigible was tied to the mast the wind would push the back all the way around the mast.

The Empire State building was erected to tether dirigibles and allow them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building constructors realized, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below,"" (para. @NUM1). Plans needed to be made to support the building and blimps. The nature also was conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles ""where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" (para @NUM2). Due to violent winds at the elevation these weights would waver the blimp and its weights. The aircrafts so were also at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" (para @NUM3).

In an attempt to keep up with The modern world, Al Smith, lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided top the building with the dirigible docking station.  Unfortunatlley, during the building process, the architects faced many obstacles that stopped them from completing the mooring mast.  One of these problems with the sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building.  Another was the flamibility of hydrogen the gas used in inflating the ship.  But the biggest obstacle was nature.  The winds that the dirigible would be facing were very strong, and pedestrians on the sidewalk were put at risk by the possibility that the ship would tear off the tether it was tied to and crash.  A final reason for the end of the mooring mast plan was a law that stated that airships couldnt fly too low over urban areas.  Although the mooring mast seemed like a great idea at the time, many obstacles stopped it from having success."	3	3		3																					
16534	6	"The builders of the Empire State building went through many obstacles. I feel bad for them because of how dangerous it was, and how long they had to work. At the same time I would have been happy to be apart of something like that. The builders could have died doing there job. Building it so high up, it must have been hot. I dont think it had to be that high they could have done the same thing but lower. Those are some of the obstacles I think the builders went through."	0	0		0

The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton."" The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents.

The excerpt mentions the German dirigible, the Hindenburg which was destroyed in a fire. ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM1).Another obstacle was nature itself.  ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lüsted, paragraph @NUM3).  The unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles.Finally, there were laws put in place restricting airships flying too low over populated areas.

16537	6	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accommodate this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the buildings frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the building's structure"	2	2		2																					
16538	6	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. One obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Another safety issue was most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire. Although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the Empire State Building realized it was not practical or safe."	3	3		3																					
16539	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle was the expanded use. New York was the lack of suitable landing area they would have. With this Al Smith saw opportunity for his building. He would add a morning mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers on and off, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea there would have to be lots of planing."	1	1		1																					
16540	6	"Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared."	3	2		3																					
16541	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Therefore the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome."	3	3		3																					
16542	6	"A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building.  If thousand-foot dirigible more debt the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add stress to the building's frame.  The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below.  The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.  The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building.  The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below.  These weights were used for open landing fields."	3	3		3																					
16543	6	"When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flameable."	1	1		1																					
16544	6	"When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment.Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast.The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished."	4	3		3																					
16545	6	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. Firsty, is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obsticles that couldn't be safely tackled."	3	3		3																					
16546	6	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was too weak to take on the extra stress of dirigible's load. Builders sat out to strengthen the building frame, a sixty-thousand dollar feat. Secondly, builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds made docking a dirigible nearly impossible, because ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obstacle builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a dirigible fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of dirigibles and what would happen if a dirigible caught on fire above New York City. Finally, builders also faced the laws regarding air traffic. The laws prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas."" in the end, the obstacles prevented builders from letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16547	6	"Based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames. The Hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as New York City. Aside from the Fire @CAPS1 the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. After realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built."	3	3		3																					
16548	6	"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I lerned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger. Another obstacle was the climate. The empire State buildings top where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nerly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast."	2	2		2

(Which is the anchor for the dirigible) The passengers of the dirigible could get on and off by walking down a gang plank to an open observation platform.In all, over sixty thousand dollers worth of modifications had to be made to the builings foundation.

16550	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builder's would want to dock the dirigibles they couldnt because there was no right area to land them. ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature it's self can take control. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles if landed on the Empire State Building would be weighed down because in the back would lead weights so, it would weight it down. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
16551	6	"The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock On the top of it. It sounded like a great idea but the builders faced many obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To do this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome nickel steel tower was made with a illuminated inside. The building was now 102 floors. Even though all the hard work the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles wer highly flamable, after one caught on fire in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State building didn't want the same to happy in the highly populated New York City. Also another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight the dirigible could never be tied down so the passengers could get off. Also there was a law that stated the air craft's can't fly to low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible was never achieved."	4	4		4

This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely.

This situation occurred to the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" fearing the wind would blow the ship onto Sharp edges or other buildings in the area. Witch would cause the shell to get punctured leading to a disaster the captain failed to attempt to reach the building on december 1930.

16557	6	"The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared.

16559	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigles to dock there was because the dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."	1	1		1																					
16560	6	"There was many obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building.

Another huge problem was saftey. Winds around New York were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to the blimb wraping around the tower and possibly break off or worse. Not to mention that all around was a densely populated city and any accident could cause much more destruction than normal. Forgein dirigibles also used mass amounts of hydrogen, which proven at Hindenburg, could explode into a massive flaming dunk of steel. This chance would be magnified with the weather and any accident would have high human and property costs. Finally, It was illegal for blimbs to fly low near a city, making the whole project illegal. As you can see there is many problems with having a blimb docking center on the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
16561	6	"Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigible could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable elements, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle, being faced, was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangeling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building.

""In likes of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown New York.

This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building ""... dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

16563	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were that first, the mast designed to go ontop of the Empire State Building was thought up just to make it the worlds tallest building, not because it was necessary, so alot of problems ar ose. This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas."	3	3		3																					
16564	6	"Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constanly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem. Most importantly there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles."	4	4		4

They needed to build a mooring mast for the dirigible to dock on the Building. This presented another problem however because if dirigible docked on the building its weight would be to much for the building. They overcame this obstacle by rienforcing the building's supports. The largest obstacle and the one that defeated this idea of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was simply the elements. The violent air currents and high winds made it impossible for a dirigible to safely tether itself to the top of the empire building.

16566	6	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd."	3	4		4																					
16567	6	"Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult. The architects and builders had to consult with experts as to how this construction should take place and whether it was safe or not. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company. Perfusive planning and many meetings later they would begin building this mooring mast.As for the building the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building they had to find another way, they did not want to put stress on the buildings frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified requiring over sixty thousand dollars. Workers got to add the mast and then construction was haulted due to danger of pedestrians, all that work for nothing."	2	2		2																					
16568	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were @CAPS1 with immediate problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The media hardship that they @CAPS1 was placing a mooring mast on top of an already completed building. ""A thousand foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame."" (¶ @NUM1) Not to mention that a large dirigible would also have placed stress on the building. Completing such a project would be extremely difficult because the building was not designed for docking dirigibles. This means the roof and the top floors would need to be converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations. Nature was also an obstacle that builders @CAPS1. High winds could cause the dirigible to violently sway. Weights used to tether the dirigibles could also be a safety hazard in a densley populated area such as @LOCATION1. Fire was another safety concern for the builders. The gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne were highly flammable and would again cause serious concern for safety in a city of millions. Ultimately all of these factors caused the creation of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to fail."	3	4		4																					
16569	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.       One obstacal the builders faced was the winds on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though the dirigible were tyed dow to the mass, the ship would swivle around the mooring mass. This would make it unsafe for pedestrians.       Another issue with landing the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly Flammable. When a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3 owners of the Empire State Building relized that accident would be much worse in down town New York."	3	3		3																					
16570	6	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low."	2	2		2																					
16571	6	The builders of the Empire State faced alot of obstacles well trying to build it. Some of these obstacles was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single table would add stress to the base of the fame. Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around. There was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable. Those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make Empire State taller.	2	2		2																					
16572	6	"The empire State building had to face dangerous condition every day like @CAPS1 winds, heavy lifting, High heights."	1	1		1																					
16573	6	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (¶@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (¶@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
16574	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 problem was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles @CAPS2 using highly Flammable gases such as hydrogen. This could be a detrimental problem if the dirigible ever caught fire above New York's public. Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal."	3	3		3																					
16575	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existance, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. The also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to way down the ship. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite alot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential."	3	2		3																					
16576	6	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are out lined. These obstacles were safety, nature, and law, Safety was an obstacle because the passengers on the dirigibles would be put in danger. This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past. Nature was an obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is un desirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone. There was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This law made it unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used. The obstacles outlined in the passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on something that wouldn't be profitable."	4	3		4																					
16577	6	"In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There was obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swivelling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1."	3	4		4																					
16578	6	"In this excerpt the builders of the empire State building were faced with many problem's trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. Also the building around it would in harms way too. As stated in paragraph @NUM2 the dock was never really ment for use. I think They just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler building."	2	2		2																					
16579	6	"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" (para @NUM1) Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dririgible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so."	3	3		3																					
16580	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the airship couldn't moor at the Empire State Building because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Another obstacle but the builders faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for airships if they ever try to approach the area."	2	2		2																					
16581	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the overall safety. Dirigibles that were built outside the U. S required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas that poses great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It finally occurred, that if a dirigible was destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially hurt a lot more people. A second obstacle that builders had to face was nature itself. At that altitude, there were violent air currents causing winds to constantly shift. This was a danger to the landing of dirigibles too. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would keep swaying. It would be harder to dock passengers, and allow for inspections. Also, dirigibles would typically weighted down with lead weights. However, because it was so high up, this was not practical or safe. The last obstacle these builders had to face were laws. One specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to tie up or even aproach the building. Overall, these obstacles denied the potential of the mooring mast."	3	4		4																					
16582	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they hadn't originally designed the building to hold a one thousand foot dirigible with a single rope."" A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.... Would add stress to the buildings frame."" @CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to handle this new stress.The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that the dirigibles are made out of a dangerous element, ""Hydrogen is very flammable."" The Empire State building builders did not want to take their chances over such a populated area.In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that wind speed at the top of the building far surpassed wind speed in other places that dirigibles could be docked. This was a problem because when they normally tied down the back end of the dirigible with a rope & led, they could no longer do because of the location that they desire to dock it. The builders of the empire state building atempted to fight architectural flaws, dirigibles safety flaws, and the flaws of nature allow dirigibles to dock there which ultimately didn't work out."	3	3		3																					
16583	6	"Al Smith had incredible vision with his plans for the Empire State Building. However, his excitement about dirigibles being allowed to dock at the top of the building, blinded him to the obvious obstacles in the way. Dirigibles themselves, were not safe modes of transportation. Hydrogen is very flammable, and would not be safe near large crowds of people, like in an urban area like New York. From a practical viewpoint the mooring mast would not work either, because of the high elevation. The height of the building would have violent winds @CAPS1 it difficult for dirigibles to land for passengers to disembark. The final major problem was that there was a law stating that  airships were not to fly too low over urban areas. Irvan Clavan summed it up when he said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" However, technology soon made dirigibles outdated."	3	2		3																					
16584	6	"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was saftey. For one reason dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is @NUM1 ft tall. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials. Also on the tethering to the mooring mast, would... ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" the idea was dangerous. To hold the dirigible to the building there would be lead weights, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast was the problems that the builders faced."	3	3		3																					
16585	6	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock."	3	3		3																					
16586	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	3		4																					
16587	6	"The ability to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, while initially lucrative, had major obstacles. The problems facing the development of the mooring mast would be cost, flammability of dirigibles, and weather over @NUM1 feet in the air. The structural and cost problems facing Al Smith was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" In order to overcome this obstacle, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and... over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made."" This is problematic because Al Smith now must spend more time and money than originally planned. Furthermore, another problem is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion ""above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York"", would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people in harms way. Finally the weather at the top of the Empire State building is unsuitable for docking dirigibles: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This is dangerous to the structure of the building, surrounding buildings, and people close by. Due to these problems, Al Smith and the engineers could not complete the Mooring Mast."	4	3		4																					
16588	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety.

Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether."	4	4		4																					
16589	6	Builders of the empire state building faced many different things while trying to build a dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to make sure it was safe to walk on the platform to get off the blimps. Also the dock had to be high so the owner could still keep the world's highest building record. But with a little hat added wasn't going to do much so building a dock was a better idea.	1	1		1																					
16590	6	"The builders of the Empire stat building encountered both man made problems and problems from nature while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was the buildings strength. The building's steel was not nearly strong inef to ""transmite pressure from the dirigibe's load to the buildings foundation."" Also ""the winds at the top of the building were always moving and full of violent air currents,"" which would shove the Zeppelin into the edges of the building. It was prohibited for airships to fly too low over urban areas, and so making it illegal for a ship to even dock to the building. Price was also a factor, along with the buildings cost an additional sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework just to make the building strong inuf to accommodate an airship. Through all of those problems the builders encountered no wonder dirigibles docking at the mooring mast was not possible."	4	3		4

One obstacle was the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make building very difficult because everything would get blown around. Another obstacle was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" That means the builders first had to make the building strong enough to hold the docking place before they could start building the docking place.These two obstacles that the builders faced made building the docking place much harder.

16593	6	The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind.

16595	6	"One of the obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building.

If the building was not strengthen, all that stress and force would collapse the building. Another obstacle faced to the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying it's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed dirigible in downtown New York puts in danger the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians of downtown.

""The winds on Top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is no where close to safe. The law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and blow onto a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles faced in docking a dirigible successfully."	4	4		4

Balloons are not very strong and if they didn't already know, it's windy on the top of the empire state building. The wind Could drive the drigible right into its spikey doom. They had no real way of keeping the drigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. From 102 stories in the air, that wasn't the safest plan. Also, most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball like that would be devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable. The builders really should have planned this out better."	3	3		3

If a blimp tried to dock there, the back would be whipped around and could end up harming someone. Being that high up, that's dangerous.Many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable as witnessed with the Hindenburg. When that happened, the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 thought it was too risky having those things flying over highly populated areas.There were laws made prohibiting low aircrafts over densely populated urban areas, so there could be no docking or they'd be breaking the law every time they did.

""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another thing that stood in the way of the Empire State Building's dock being used was the danger it presented to the buildings and people below. The gas, hydrogen, that dirigibles used to float is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire,... the owners... realized how much worse the accident would have been... above a densely populated area."" The third and final obstacle they faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With all that potential danger and to discouragement, it's no wonder the Empire State building was never used for docking dirigibles."	4	3		4																					
16603	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. Because it was held by a Single Cable tether that would add Stress to the buildings frame. Another obstacle was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the Building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even though, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new Situation. Overall, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."	2	1		2																					
16604	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in making a dirigible docking stations. One of the main things was that there was a law in place that banned the use of low flying aircrafts in urban areas, like New York City. Another reason is that it was just not safe to dock these massive blimps that high. Almost @NUM1 hundred feet up the winds would have been very violent, and with the tailend of the dirigible not being fastened down, it was very likely that it could get spun around and end up tangled with the mast. Also it was not safe because many foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen which was highly flamable, and if an- accident similar to the Hindenburg with fire occurred over in urban place like New York City it could have been very tragic. Lastly in order to build the mast builders had to re inforce the frame of the building so that it could bear the stress that such a station would put on the structure."	3	4		4																					
16605	6	"In the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building, builders were faced with several different obstacles. One obstacle the builders faced was how they were going to modify the building to be able to support a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" because it would add too much stress to the buildings frame. Another obsticle along with the modifications to the buildings' frame was the money. Building this new structure would cost, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"". One of the most important obsticles however was safety. Although most blimps in the united states use helium, outside countries mainly use hydrogen. Hydrogen, being highly flamable, was absolutely out of the question to be in a city as highly and densely populated as New York. The other safety hazards included the winds which were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" because the back of the blimp could not be weighed down and also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make their attempts not only dangerous, but illegal. In the end, the mooring mast was never completed."	4	4		4																					
16606	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didnt interfer with the building. Also another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. Because if a blimp go to close to an urban city like @CAPS1.Y and have all thos flamable fuels leak out. It would be a big disaster. These are the obstacles the builders faced."	1	1		1																					
16607	6	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large deregible tied to the building mast would add stress to the building which could cause the building to collapse. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire its metal frame could fall to the ground endangering citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to Place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these problems the mast could never be used."	3	3		3																					
16608	6	When Designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the empire state Building there were @CAPS1 oBstacles that the @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 were faced with. One proBlem was they couldent @CAPS4 drop the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building Because it was too @CAPS5 for the frane of the Building. So Because of that proBlem The @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 had to come up with a way to modifey the frame of the Building so that the Building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem that they were faced with was that it was @CAPS4 too dangerous. I was deemed dangerous Because most dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen which was extremely flammable and they couldent @CAPS8 having @CAPS9 happend to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors aBove city streets that were crowded with people. So those Were @CAPS4 a few oBsticals that @CAPS2 were faced with when building the mooring mast on top of the empire state Building	3	2		3																					
16609	6	The @CAPS1 says the greatest obstacle would be nature itself. The wind would blow the blimps on to the Sharp spires of other buildings.	1	1		1																					
16610	6	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.	3	3		3																					
16611	6	"After finishing the @ORGANIZATION1, architects want to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems the architect had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was the most @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, ad after the Hindenburg @CAPS2 up in @ORGANIZATION2, architects feared a similar catastrophe could happen in @CAPS3, but many more would die. Another problem was high winds. Because it was so windy at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady. Also, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building because there was nothing holding down the front and back. the third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the Empire State Building. That's why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16612	6	"There were many obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First off as stated in para graph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows an obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @MONEY1 of funds would be needed. The funds leading to the stregthing and modification of the steel frame. Thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation. Second the greatest concern was safety. This is brought to hand because most drigibles are very flammable. They consist of Helium, which is a extremly flammable gas. Also if the drigible were to mount to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would be swaying around and around. This possibly having a chance of dis-mounting and it crashing into a densly populated area of people. These are some reasons that the obstacles of attempting to allow drigibles to dock on the top of the empire state building."	3	3		3																					
16613	6	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One such obstacle that the builders had overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e. plains or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project were shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
16614	6	"To design a mast for the dirigibles to land was no easy matter architects could not just plop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof The stress from a thousand foot dirigible would transmit weight and wind pressure all the way to the foundation. To be able to create this mast the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthend. First, the architects ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a steeped-back design that imitated the overall shapp of the building itself."" This rocket shapped mast would have four wings at its corners of aluminum and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery. Finnally, when this was all completed the existing plans for the building were to be put in place."	1	1		1																					
16615	6	"There were many obstacles which the builders of the mooring mast had to face. They thought it was going to be an easy task to accomplish as shown in paragraph eight where Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and he responded ""[It's] on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" This shows how truly sure Smith was about the goal's simplicity.Although determination was a great factor in the building of this world wide known monument, problems kept standing in the way of success. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the author describes how the Empire State building would not be able to fulfill it's purpose, even though workers should've known better. She states ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 kept pooring down, one of them being nature.Finally the workers gave up after the project was postpone due to mainly safety reasons. By the late 1930's, the idea of the mooring mast had almost disappeared. All that really matters is that they tried, and all it took was just one dream."	2	2		2																					
16616	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the first problems they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (Lüsted, @NUM1). The builders would have to keep this in mind. The next obstacle they faced was nature and its winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents,"" (@NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable. Lastly, the builders had to worry about the law pertaining to airships flying too low over urban areas ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" (@NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
16617	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety, nature, and law in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The issue of safety became apparent because most dirigibles made outside of the @LOCATION1 were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. To risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating. Nature too became a problem in the futile attempt of the builders. With such ""Violent air currents"" (¶ @NUM1), the dirigible would swivel around even if it were tied up to the mooring mast. Finally, law was an obstacle to the builders. Existing legislation banned airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM2), meaning the dirigibles would have no way of landing atop the urban building. obstacles such as safety, nature, and law hindered be attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
16618	6	"In the @CAPS1, the docking of dirigibles had many issues. One, boarding passengers would be very difficult as the dirigible will @CAPS2 from a gust of wind. Second, the gases used to make afloat are highly flammable, and explode quite easily."	1	1		1																					
16619	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to have dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a huge safety issue; ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flamible"" (paragraph @NUM1) if an accident happened (lets say to the magnitude of the Hindenburg) over New York City, thousands of people could die because of this highly flamible substance. Secondly a very large problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building work constantly shifting due to air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the wind was out of controll and the dirigible wasn't tied down right, the harsh winds could be dangerously dangeling over the people of New York. Amongst many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have ever been thought of as a reality."	2	2		2																					
16620	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted you learn about the plans for the Empire State Building but, you also learn why the Mooring Mast cannot be used for it's original purpose. The Mooring Mast was planned to be used as a docking station for dirigibles, or blimps. One reason why the Mooring Mast could not dock these is because places outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The excerpt states ""Most dirigibles outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable."" (¶ @NUM1) @CAPS1 they did not a huge fire in a highly populated area. Another reason why it would not work was violent air currents. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be wirled around the mooring mast."" (¶ @NUM2) @CAPS1 with that problem they would have to worry about the mast being taken out. The last reason is because of a law. The excerpt states ""an existing law against airships flying too lower over urban areas"" (¶ @NUM3) The building mast was to close to humans to let them dock there. @CAPS1 while the mast was a brilliant idea it could not be done now it is only a dream."	4	3		4																					
16621	6	"The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely hard for a captain to control their ship. When anchored to the mast by a single tether, the dirigible would be twisted around the spire by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers. Another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in New York City. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never accomplished their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast. "	2	3		3																					
16622	6	"An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 was weight. If the story it says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly @NUM1 feet below."" Another obstacle was nature. The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

In paragraph nine it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" @CAPS1 they had to modify and strengthened the whole thing to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they had to face, was that hydrogen was highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that an accident like that could be worse in the crowded streets of New York. Another obstacle was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around, but could be held down with lead weights, but like paragraph @NUM1 says ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling, is neither practical nor safe."" / Time"	4	3		4																					
16624	6	"The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. for example it would have been almost impossible to dock with the violent winds blowing at that height. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". It would not have been @CAPS2 to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the law of airships flying to low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" That's saying that even if a dirigible could moor at the Empire State Building, It's illegal because all airships have to fly a certain height over urban area. The workers building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were just to great to overcome. Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will."	3	3		3																					
16625	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. The most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation. The constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted. Another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable. After all the hard work to be successful. Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of New York."	2	2		2																					
16626	6	"Dirigibles are large steel-frame balloons enclosed by cotton and filled with hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930's, the new idea came about that the dirigibles would dock at the top of the Empire State Building in New York. After reading The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we have learned of the obstacles the builders were faced with. The author notes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The dirigibles would constantly be moving and shifting. The author also states, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law was set in place for safety reasons.

16627	6	"The builders of the Empire State building had numerous obstacles in their way if they planned on allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first and most serious problem was the safety of the passengers as well as pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. In 1937 in New Jersey the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This catastrophe would have been worse if it were take place over the heads of people in New York city.Nature also posed a huge threat to the completion of the docking mast. Due to the air currents on the top of the building the blimp (dirigible) would constantly be shifting. The only way to control the swaying of the blimp would be to use weights to hold the blimp down, which would again put the public at risk.Along with natural hazards it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the Empire State building because of an existing law. The idea to allow dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical."	4	3		3																					
16628	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there like nature, law, and of the sharp spire. Nature was proably the biggest problem because you can't control wind. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building were so strong cause ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."" This would make it hard to land and unland the dirigibles. Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it. If a dirigible was to hit it it would pop the dirigible and kill many people below."	3	3		3																					
16629	6	"The one obstacle the builders had when trying to build this building was not away for the dirigibels landing to be convinient for all. The dirigibels have a very fast speed of eight miles per hour, and they were as big as four blocks of New York City, paragraph @NUM1. This was a problem for the builders because the dirigibels were very big, and the building it self as well. The siz was a problem because the enormouse dirigibels woud not be landing in the right space. Having lack of time was always a problem because the building would not be completed on time. The builders always had to hold back because ""engineers consulted with experts... architects met with presidents"" paragraph @NUM2. Holding back on the making of the buiding to meet with thouse people took away time. When there is something very high, and wide in the way there will be a problem."	2	0		0																					
16630	6	"Some of the problems with the constructing of docking dirigibles were that, natural causes like high winds said in ¶ 6.

Another set back was it being illegal to fly an aircraft that low, it was ""illegal for ship to tie up to a building,"". Also it was dangerous for dirigibles that ran on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable.

Weeks past and @PERSON1s mom still hasnt returned. Every night now @PERSON1 cried hoping her mom would come. During the day she would wait watching for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now.

Two years have passed since @PERSON1s mom had left. @PERSON1 didnt cry as much but still waited. Waited for her mother @CAPS3 come back. One day @PERSON1 heard a knock on the door, she answered it and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, then hugged each other. They both cried and her mom whispered Im sorry. @CAPS3 @PERSON1. Now @PERSON1 and her were unseperatable. They never left each others side again."	11	12		23				2	3	3	3			3	3	3	3								
17841	7	Un Patience @CAPS1.   My name is @CAPS2 and I have a very hipper non patience horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a chestnut quarter horse with a white star on his forehead who is very un patient. He is always hipper and ready to go. For example when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride in our back trains he dose not stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. And when we are on the ride he always is so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And thats when he gets unpatient. No matter what he will not stand still and wait for the group so I have to spin him around and walk back to the group. Meany times I have tried training him to be patient but I have always failed. I guess he just always has to be doing something. But I will always love him no matter how un patience he is.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

17860	7	Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have savere anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family!!! They had grandkids that really annoyed me!!! My foster family had a different religion than me I am atheist. They are @CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me I am wrong!!! It made me very upset but I didnt say nothing because I was being patient. And I hate it. With my anger problems im very surprised I didnt go off on them? But yes patience does take practice lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient!!! Tolerance twords children I dont like kids to much but where I wed to live there were tons of little kids that were the grand kids of my foster family and I sued those kids are annoying but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate and so are guardian parents they are the worst they tell you what to do and they aint even youre parents but I tolerated it.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

When we got going I had to wait for over @NUM1 hours to get where we were going but when we got there we had fun.

Are family it also verey forgetful. That is probably another reason why we arnt patient. Patients is im portant because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait turn.

17873	7	"A long time ago me and my family were going to a cottage we owned. It was about a four hour drive. It is the funniest place to go to. I was so happy I couldnt wait until we got there. I new I had to be patient. But I wanted to get there so bad. But if I would complain a lot I knew I would get in trouble. I know that because I had to learn the way. About a couple weeks before that we had to visit my grandma, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking to long. Then when we got home later on that hight I got my phone taken away for a week, so after that I knew not to complain ever again about something taking to long. So on our way to my grandmas cottage I didnt complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are unpatient dont go on long trips. Its good to be patient since I was patient the whole ride to my grandmas my mom was happy with me. If you are patient people will know that you are a very tolerant person."	9	7		16				2	2	2	3			1	1	2	3

I was still being patient, because I didnt want to go to school. I dont like coming in the middle of class, because everybody stares at you. The doctor finaly came to check on me then I got different color rubber bands on. Also the doctor  came to see me and see if my bracese were all right.

So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me so I just sat there and waitted.

We went to my @ORGANIZATION1s sisters house and my @ORGANIZATION1 and aunt (my @ORGANIZATION1s sister) were going to teach me hoe to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and the teacher wouldnt do it for you. They said if I learned to tie my shoes I would get to pick something out at the dollar store so that got me all excited! When we got their after I had lunch they began teaching me. The tirck they taught me went like this: after you have the first crossover step you make the bop(tree) and you put the other string around it (the bunny loving around the tree. @CAPS1 you put it through (the bunny darling in its hole.) @CAPS1 youre bond. After many tries was starting to get the hang of it. Later we went back to my house and my @ORGANIZATION1 kept helping me. Finally one afternoon I got it, my @ORGANIZATION1 was happy and she kept telling me good job. Later we went to the store and picked something out! My @ORGANIZATION1 had to be patient with me.

He would yell, and possiblely cursed at me in chinease. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something. But my mom will contune explain to me until I understand what @CAPS1 means.

Patience is an important part of the swimming you have to be patient when waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instruction when learning a new stroke learning a new way to turn at the wall, ect. On the first day of swim team this year the coaches went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who knew this stuff already, like me it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a good job listening. Patience is important."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
17881	7	Patience what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it we could all be patient. One time when I was in @LOCATION1 we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and we rod no wait for any of the rides. The next time we went there we had to be patient because the lines were really long. I could wait but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still. Another example about patences is when the miners got stated in the mine in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 days they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when the were coming up from the mine in that little elevator thingy magig. One last example on patence is when you are walking in a group with other people you have to be patient and listen to there ideas and let them do some of the work. These I think are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient.	6	6		12				1	1	2	2			1	1	2	2

17899	7	"@CAPS1! Look out! @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deaffening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. T he eery silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to @CAPS9 they concidered safety. In no way, was this to be concidered safety, for this was the beginning of one living-nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Heres a picture of @CAPS9 I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood triddes out from his many cuts. Its unbearable to watch. Ambulences sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And thats @CAPS9 scares me most. II still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in someways, Id lost my mother as @CAPS6. @CAPS5d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadnt made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, Id still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constently, never listening to @CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe its just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldnt know because in no way we we typical. When we arent fighting about who- knows- @CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. @CAPS4, @CAPS5 starts, I know I havent been patient with you lately, and for that Im sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing. I give her a questioning, gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself? @CAPS5 didnt have to explain any farther. @CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around, my voice caught in my throat, just to get my stupid notebook. A single tear weaved its way down my face. @CAPS7, hunny! my mother teared up as @CAPS6. That doesnt make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way! I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was to win that fight. @CAPS8, I said, regaining composure, thats how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe overtime I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8. @CAPS9 shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mothers lips. I will wait then. And then @CAPS5 hugged me. @CAPS5 hugged me as @CAPS5 had when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and unhesitantly. I could feel the beginning of a new found relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as it had been, but definately there. With patience and time, it has bloomed into a healthy relationship, in which we both can enjoy and respect."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

17908	7	"One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you  are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one.I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree.I was lucky I had a camoflage shirt on, because if I didnt blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldnt have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3								
17909	7	"I was patient a few years ago with my brother @PERSON1. It was almost his birthday, and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television, the helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birth day or not .He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it so he kept bugging me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying .I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didnt work, because he kept on asking me any way. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally he stopped asking me about the helicopter and after we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly."	10	11		21				3	3	2	2			3	3	2	3

One day my brother was down loading new ringtones, which I thought was no big dig deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone.  The mosquito tone is a loud highpitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. Its really funny if you the one playing it but if your listening to it. it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother has this idea. the one only a jerk could have. he decides hes going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible, it made my blood curtle. After thirty minutes I decided to call my but it didnt really help. Then I listened to music, so he turned it up. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone I would give him back his battery. Of cource he said yes so I didnt have to the tone anymore.

I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it a lot not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend finally came and when I asked my dad was he ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why not he said it was because I didnt keep my mouth shut so my mom didnt want me to have it at the moment. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says nor has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then my dad walked in the room and said maybe tomorrow that so happened to be @DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. Thats exactly what I did and I got my game.

17938	7	"Patience is important in life. Something when you dont have patience things tend to go wrong and thats not always a good thing so here are somethings when you do not have patience. If you dont have patience you can get into trouble. For example if you were in a long line for something and you couldnt talk because if you did talk you would get in trouble. So if you didnt have any patience you would probably say @CAPS1 my gosh this is taking forever. Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example if you didnt you would need patience if you were sick and you went to the doctors office and there was a really long line you would probably say for get it and then go home. So if you went home you would get even more sick and that would get even more sick and that would be bad. Finally, another reason on if you didnt have patience. For example say you wanted to go the mall and bye a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out the cash regaster didnt work so they had to call maitnence, to come and fix it and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes but you did not have any patience so you said for get it and you left and didnt get the shoes. Those were some people who didnt have patience. But if they did that wouldnt of happened to them because they would of waited or needed. Having patience is a good thing but not having it is not."	5	4		9				0	1	2	2			0	1	1	2

When I was in the store my cousin was patience out an outfit and I was taking a long time. When my brother and I was in the shore he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patience.

Patience isnt just waiting a long time, its being respectfull and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectfull and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. If your at school and need to go to the bathroom wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when their talking. People will like you a little more if your patient.

17981	7	"Hi, im writing about the topic patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience everyone would be running crazy like banshees and getting mad al the time. It is important to have patients  because In life its not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example when I go to get my allergy shots I have to be patient. Because other people got @CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient at my football games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @CAPS1 spot the whole game. Lots of people that arent patient make other people not patient. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience. That is what this world need, a little more patience. THE @CAPS2."	6	5		11				0	2	2	2			1	1	1	2

My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted ""I did it"" and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did!

At that time I was about to lose my patience but I kept it. Why? Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly took the plane rather than a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1.

There is a time when I had to wait an hour. The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom danced me off at @NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a little yearly. After I waited five minutes I had worried that maybe they were in a different class but no they werent. After waiting thirdy minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at @TIME1. I could of called home but I didnt have my phone. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. Me and myself swinging alone. When I was @TIME1 my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, it starts at @TIME1. So I have to leave. She kept asking me why I didnt call and I kept telling her I didnt have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is humble to me. I can go fifteen minutes but I cant go an hour. Thats one of the horrible times I was patient."	8	9		17				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3

They called a kid whos name was @PERSON1, and I thought it was me because my names @PERSON2. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but its just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finnally finished all the magazines and I was bored. I watched people get called and called finnally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with there machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half and hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I dont know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finnally got out and went home.

One day my uncle typed up an application for the job he wanted. When he was done he copied and paste it for an email. When he pressed send he hurried and grabbed his phone hoping for the job. He looked at his phone right when he got up making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call @CAPS2 still nothing. It was one week and he was thinking about calling the place @CAPS2 he didnt. Then he got a phone call that afternoon so he quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. I was just my mom asking if he got the job @CAPS2 all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning he got a call and he picked it up screaming, @CAPS1 do you want! @CAPS2 not knowing it was the boss for the job. So he apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited forever sort of patiently and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really loved how he got it and now knew you always knew to be patient and everything will work out great.

But my sister always helped me when she had time. I thought I would never do it right. And thats when she told me these words practice makes perfect she let me choose from her best string selection. And she slowly went over how to do it. And before I knew it I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time.

18030	7	"I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby sat @DATE1. I was babysitting with older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four-months old baby girls for eight hours! Let me tell you babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cries a lot and for a long time so it took a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used patient was to fell them asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house and bouncing her up and down it my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when her baby, @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still very fun: and you can see that @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 were lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1, through it."	10	11		21				3	2	2	3			3	3	2	3

18034	7	"Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friends house on a trapoline one hot @DATE1 day. When my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @PERSON1. My mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. I thought okay what ever I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day I kept selling my mom excuses why I couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. So after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. In the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. Those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. There was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. The doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stoped caring. Finally I was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 and had to go to doctor. The doctor's office was exstremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctors office. Some times being patient has rewards.  My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

At gym, she didnt grab the volleyball when someone had it the their shoe so she wouldnt be boared instead she stood there. During the end of the @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1 next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason. Every one learned to raise their hands and not push when they  left the classroom. Prity soon every one started getting candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3 I huged my @CAPS4 so hard then I told her what happened at school.

Patient, a patient, or patience. Out there? Im going to talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning I had to take a trip. Not a field trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctors office. Why did I need to? To get my yearly vaccine, thats why. The morning probably wasnt really cold. I was just nervous, when we arrived at the doctors office ,(which seemed like it was even far away) the office man even called me and my dad up to the front window. He said I have an appointment for my son. And the lady at the front window said the @NUM1 appointment? @CAPS1 thats the one said my dad . Your son looks to be scheduled for, tetns vaccined @CAPS2 then told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, reading my book. After a while I started to feel uncased. I was quite bored, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes making funny statements, so he told me you know what? Youre a patient patient! I laughed. My laughing was cut out by the doctor opening the door. Before knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. But what I learnt was that being a patient patient, helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasnt so patient , it mightve hurt. I learned an important lesson that day."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

My mom knew that my grandma would want her to be happy, thats why she watched her every move.

18134	7	Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding or it can mean to be tolerant. Being patient can also mean you dont complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they dont get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you shouldnt get mad. You can also be paitient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you dont have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means.	7	5		12				1	2	2	2			0	1	2	2

One day @ORGANIZATION1 went to get her hair cut at mtso fast saloon! When @ORGANIZATION1 got there everyone was screaming at @CAPS1 the hair cutter and @ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said hey if you want your hair to look good sit down and be quiet and everybody did. @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a beautiful haircut just like everybody else and then @ORGANIZATION1 because the mayor of unpaciente  land renamed it @CAPS2 land from that day forward every body was pacient.	9	9		18				2	3	2	2			2	2	3	2

He was getting his knee looked at; @CAPS1 were in that waiting room for like two or three hours! Jody (my step mom) was getting really irritated I told her that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone. That kind of made @CAPS2 relax because usually Im not very patient usually everyone tells @CAPS2 that Im really impatient. For some reason when Im really excited Im fairly patient. I was exulted to see if he could get his knee brace off. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! This was a time when I was patient."	9	9		18				2	2	2	3			3	2	2	2

That night after dinner I found that I wanted to stay instead of going to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. A little part of me wanted to go to sleep but I also wanted to stay up. I made some more food and went to sleep. When morning came I was so happy I ran into the living room. Sure enough there was the presents. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some to @NUM3 came and I wanted to open them so??? I knew it wouldt be right so I went to sleep??? At noon I woke up and ran to the living room.

18162	7	A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 took a few hours so here is @CAPS2 story. We were leaving the house when I realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog penny [she is real not fake] @CAPS2 dog bitted out the door and I put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandmas and grandpas house and rest. We travelled through lots of roads until we got to the highway. @CAPS1s gonna be a long ride I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second we lost our grandparents car. I looked back and behind about twelve cars I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Daring @CAPS2 nap @CAPS2 parents [@CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasnt nice. We now have one more state to go through and then were in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and ate breakfast. Then on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two hour drive to go. Longest five hours even but I was patient so @CAPS1 was fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned his gos and we found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.	8	11		19				2	2	2	2			3	3	2	3

She was asking me to turn on the music and I said no, she through a fit. So I got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she get hit, in a nice and kind voice. And she stopped. And I told her to sit down and be quiet and watch tv. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was desterbing me. I didnt become a mean person at that point. Last but not least that was a time that I was a patient person."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
18164	7	Patience for me is when im helping others with their problems so in this story im going describe to you what is patience. Patience is when you are willing to sit down and help someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience cause I sit down all the time and help people with their problem. One day at my old school @PERSON1 this girl she was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school she was crying. I went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying the way she doesnt want to be at home because he mom dont let her go nowhere she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat down all day with her and let her feel like she had some one to talk to for once in her life. As we sit in talked she seemed to feel much better and she felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion I really felt like I had patience and since that day forward I have sat down and let people tell me about their problems.	11	8		19				3	3	2	3			2	2	2	2

I @MONTH1 not get the services I want, but at least Ill have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so Im not the most patient person in the world, but this is worth it! You see, Im going into track, cross-country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am deticated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, shes transferred everything, Ive proved Im deticated, Ive kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, Ive been watching the neighbors pets while they are away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and Im working on cleaning the house and keeping it clean. So far, Ive been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I,m responsible. Even my brother and half-sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isnt sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. Ill probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, Ill have to continue everything Im doing now. So, I wont be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom!

18187	7	"A time I was patient was in @DATE1 at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was about @NUM1 in the @TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes till the first @PERSON1 came on stage, the name of their @PERSON1 was @LOCATION2. Their appearance was strange so they looked like a rock @PERSON1. But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heared of ever but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, but they wern't my taste of music. The next @PERSON1 was one I new lots about; their name is the @PERSON1, they were great. There lead lead singer had a long beared and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I have heard of his name was @PERSON2, he was also great. He even made up a song at the top of his head about @LOCATION1 and never stoped for like four minutes. Then he was done and the time was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night by now. And I was getting tired. But right there I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready I was really excited, they opened up with a song named @CAPS3. And there was strobe lights and regular lights every were. The staid that was holding the drum even moved. It did @NUM4?, and a @NUM5. It went @NUM2 feet in the air and did flips and everything you can @CAPS4. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum off, that was cool. That went till about @NUM7 it was amazing.

We get up round @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes light up because we get loose all the presents we get to open. First we lay on the couch and stare at them trying to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them at a different angle. We do that until we both end upon the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed. But it does no use because we never do. Then about @NUM2 am we start getting gosy. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off of it, but that never works raither. Then we go back on the couch. About @NUM3 am we go into our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need there coffee before we open presents. then we go and wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally about @NUM4 min later they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end."	11	11		22				2	3	3	3			3	3	2	3

I was there for @NUM1 hour but did I care no because l was the one who wanted to come whith and l came. If l would of complained then she would of said then why did you come. @CAPS1 at the end my mom said since you have been patient then you can get a chocolate bar @CAPS1 if your patient, there might be a reward at the end."	6	8		14				2	1	2	1			2	2	2	2

After I rides and @NUM2 mins. @CAPS1 said the words I thought hed never say, @CAPS3, your turn. I looked at him then the truck. Wow does he look small next to that truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climed onto the tires rim, then to the, top of the tire, and into the cab. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, gaggag @CAPS7. Oh yeah! This felt right.

So I invited my friends over and we were going to landslide skate park. We were all at my home but @CAPS1 wasnt. My mom said @CAPS2 hes not here in two minutes we have to go with out him. So I was mad I was writing a note to put on the door that reads @CAPS1, we had to go with out you because you were late! Sorry be on time next time.-@CAPS4.

We had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @NUM1 minutes have gone by, sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace. One time me, and my dad were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like a few weeks. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal. A bad patience is when youre late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. Sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves. So you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace. @ORGANIZATION1."	7	6		13				0	2	2	3			1	1	2	2

You have to be patient with people to, like people who are learning or you are teaching. I was patient in @ORGANIZATION1 which was really hard to do. When I was really little mabey four or five years old, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to go on a ride but I couldnt go because I was to short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @CAPS1 went on the ride. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not get antcy. After a while I started asking When is the ride going to be over mama she kept responding I dont know, when ever @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 get off the ride. @CAPS2 I couldnt wait, but when my @CAPS1 and sister got off they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said ok and thats when I got sad then she said to me but because you waited so long and nicely I will take you to get a smoothy. I love smoothys I scream.

Another doctor came in and felt it until finally my mom asks ""what's going on here"". They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a theiroid which is glands in your neck that are full which leads to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later we went to get my blood checked. As we waited I started to get really nervous I had butterflys  really bad and then @NUM1 minutes passed which seemed like an hour they called me in and I sat down the nurse said everything will be fine. So i trusted her she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm it sorta hurt like a pinch then @NUM2 @NUM3 @NUM4 and the needle went in and I seen the blood going into the tube really cool then we went home.

Being patience in the game of chess or checkers is important because while the other persons makes his or her move  you can be thinking of what move you will make to counter attack it. Patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork. Patience is also about waiting.

I didnt know her had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me I froze, no one has ever had a broken bone in my family before so I didnt know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car mom didnt say anything like how much pain she was in or anything. When we got to the car I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now to those who dont know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in a backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also when your mom has a broken bone and is in alot of pain, and the bikes wont go in the backseat the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since Im not to yet she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the emergency room we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes on how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didnt once complain or whine about the pain she was in. she didnt yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyper ventalate right there and then. She was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldnt have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I wouldve been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me.

My teacher apologized for the mix-up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you but dont give up because it will turn out alright in the end.

I said just do the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiney I need help. @CAPS1 I helped him. It took alot of patience, and I was very patient, for him taking an hour long. I check over his work while him and my mom had a fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no two answers right. While I patiently wait for him to get out of the shower, I get a separate piece of paper copied down the problems, answered them, and got them right. When @PERSON1 gets out of the shower I hide the answer sheet. He got mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills I helped him. At student led confereces I seen he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient filled paper."	8	12		20				2	2	2	2			3	3	3	3								
18284	7	"Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day. You can be waiting for a check, you could wait for a letter. Sometimes paitents can be fast or be slow. @CAPS2 can be used in school or even a job. If you wait in patience on standing things could happen to you. For a test you can use patience by waiting for an answer to a question by waiting a little longer to get the answer instead of going fast and not getting @CAPS2 right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments  @CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you are building a model you have to use patients so @CAPS2 is right not having patients @CAPS2 will be wrong. That is what patients means to me and everyone has to use @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 is part of your daily life."	5	6		11				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	3

18291	7	"What is patience? Patience is the act of thing understanding, tolerate and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1 was born @DATE1. Since birth my mother has dreaded the day of potty training whom she knew would be coming soon. As you @DATE1 know the price of diapers and pull-ups has gotten pretty expensive so when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years started potty training. Potty training requires alot of patience because sometimes the child @DATE1 not go to the potty and @DATE1 go on or herself. My mom knows this but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all knew to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be olde to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull-up. Many good things can come out of just being patient."	11	11		22				3	3	2	3			3	3	2	3

18293	7	"I am patient in a lot of stof, when I play I am patient. When I take a test I am patient. I am almost patient in everything. Lots of people are patient too. Some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer there not patient. They just want to take the ball and score. One time I was playing at the park with my friends I was playing soccer my friend told me to pass the ball. He was not patient at all that day."	5	6		11				1	1	1	2			1	1	2	2								
18294	7	"Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, youre quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching goal(s). In situations such as sports games arguments, disaster, and many other occurrances, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when youre waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates arent doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smooth, and by respecting sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house-fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that youve lost, and youve enable to think clearly a bait what has just happened Ive experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what Im trying to say is that when youre patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you @MONTH1 not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isnt a bundle of roses all the time, so soon or later, youre going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isnt human nature but its indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast importance of patience, so we all can live better lives, Im certainly not implying that we need to hurry up and learn this trait, no, we simply need to learn it patiently."	9	7		16				0	3	3	3			0	2	2	3

18304	7	Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is till patient. Some people learn how to have a good patience by learning from an elder or some model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you well for sure be good with kids of all ages. Work very good with moody people. Patience also has to work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesnt listen very well so you have to have some patience with that so they listen. I f someone doesnt have very good respect for people it well take patience to work with them so they can have good respect!

I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she not all that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, but other times, I have no patience at all. I try my hardest to be patient. If its @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When its my birthday I try to be patient. When were going somewhere special, or Im trying to do my homework, I try to be patient too! Its like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I cant always be patient, is that, something I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times, when Im cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though Im super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something your a  natural with. Like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesnt come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that every one should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you dont have patience in school. You wont be patient with your boss when you get a job. Dont get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/ teenegers arent always patient either.

18317	7	It was the day of central @LOCATION1 and it was after school that I was in the paraid with my football team and the line was going really slow and eventally we have done and it was off the home with my best friend @PERSON1. Well his preparing me and I went to his house and played a little and then we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1s there were about @NUM1 cars and they were all in the drive through and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game didnt start until @NUM2 and it was @NUM3. So we sat there patiently and ordered are food and left to go to the football game. And thats a time when I was patient.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
18318	7	Patience is hard. You always @CAPS1 it now not later. You must stay calm and be pieceful in patience that they almost forgot what they are whating for but I always @CAPS1 it now too. I can't stand not having something. If theres a test on @DATE1 .I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't what that long and it gives my tension just knowing whats going to happen. If you have patience it's almost like a gift just like singing and dancing one a gift.	6	8		14				0	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didnt say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift-shop-like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. @CAPS4 offered me a @DATE1 job after my sixth grade year helping him out at work. Little did I know that what @CAPS4 was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often dont meet the smartest, well-educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere.  @CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.  I muttered to myself as a middle-aged man walked up to me. @CAPS4 read my name tag that had the blue- and- white company logo of youngs incorporated.  @CAPS3, youre with youngs?  @CAPS4 asked.   Do you know where the show room is?  I could tell what @CAPS4 was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a cooporation?  @CAPS1 the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.  I said in a robotic voice.  @CAPS6t  you a little young to be doing this kind of work?  @CAPS4 asked.  You were expecting maybe an intern?  I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent  @CAPS8, sir.  @CAPS9 old are you?  @CAPS4 asked quizzically.  @CAPS11, sir. I lied.  I knew I could pass for a high schooler,  so I knew @CAPS4d  believe me.  I was really wishing that @CAPS4 would move along, because I getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @CAPS12 healthy. Are you getting paid?  @CAPS12 enough to put up with the likes of you.  I thought.  I took a deep breath,  and answered,  yes,  sir.  But its @CAPS12 a lot.  Its more like volunteer work,  really.  @CAPS13 dont ask any more questions, I thought.  @CAPS4 smiled and walked on,  thanks son. Youre welcome.  I said through partially clenched teeth.  I think well both agree that I was patient that day.  And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dads shop, because if @CAPS4 didnt, I will be very put out.  That is the time when I was the most patient."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3								
18320	7	"Patience when a person is patient the can wait a thousand years   for an answer. Or he/she is understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time, and keep his cool. That is amazing. Patience is when the person is always their when you need help and he will give you patience by just around him. I think patience is calm, doesnt lose his temper and helps you when you need a little boost of patience"	6	6		12				0	2	2	2			0	2	2	2

So I did what she told me while wondering where @CAPS9 were going. When @CAPS9 got there, I knew exactly where @CAPS9 were. @STATE1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. @CAPS3 going to go on @CAPS4 @CAPS5, want to come, I asked my mom. @CAPS6, sounds like fun she replied. When @CAPS9 got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. @CAPS7, I dont want to wait mom, its too long of a line, I complained. @CAPS8 patient, sweety @CAPS9ll @CAPS8 on the coaster in no time, she replied. One hour later mom its taking forever. I whimpered. @CAPS9 are the next ones in line, she replied still smiling.

18326	7	"Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got it all from my dad. Usually. I will get impatient when I'm waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving for dance, sometimes we go to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are annoying me. For example, when someone is making random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs so much I just want to scream ""stop talking"". Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a lecture that gets repeated and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear them."	6	5		11				1	1	2	2			0	1	2	2

I didnt know at first but it came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paint hall shooting. And he said ok. But before we go he said can you cut the grass for me. I said ok. So I cut the grass which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes so I told him Im done and he said ok, so I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. And when I got done takns my shower I called my friends and cousins to see if they would to come and they said sure. So I asked my dad when are we going to leave to go pointball shooting. He told me it is going to be at a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasnt going to be today. They were ok with it.

Everyone who @CAPS1 in the class @CAPS1 so patient when these events happen. It @MONTH1 take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak @CAPS2, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog @CAPS1 a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @CAPS1 a sign of being under control and patient? Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. Not to mention, it @CAPS1 what @CAPS1 respectful.

During that time to the time the line moved again I had occupied myself by watching people on the @CAPS3 and other rides go by. The line moved up again. Watching people didnt work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the maverick would be to ride, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half way in the line. My patience was running out. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didnt want to go back, what I would miss, and was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every seconde. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and move up.

But then I couldnt take it, I started to get so mad, wanted to just get out of there. But I didnt let my dad know, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out, and said @CAPS1, and I was releved that the doctor finally came to give me shots. But what I didnt know was that I was going getin horrible pain for a few days."	11	12		23				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

Most of the @NUM1 on @NUM1 shots didnt matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was @NUM1 to @NUM6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a @NUM1 on @NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stoped it. That was even of the only shots of the game and I stoped it."	10	8		18				2	3	2	3			2	2	2	2								
18424	7	"@CAPS1 on hurry up, my friend said. I know, be patient, I said. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed.

Some of the other things I hate to wait through are lines, people being late and just plain old waiting around.

18445	7	"Patience can come in different was in life. For one thing, it can reward you at the end. For example, it can come in a bigger way if you are patient because it would be a bigger reward to you. Another thing is that it lets you do other things in the process. For example you could wait for something, you could do something else when its time you deserve it. Another thing is that it might be difficult, but you can control it if your calm. For example, people cant wait so they just want to rush and get to be done with it. My final reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second wouldnt be so hard because you would be calm. That is patience in my own way."	5	4		9				0	1	2	2			0	1	1	2

The dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older women came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision. After the women went to get treated, a little girl comes walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girls tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth.

Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or somthing in a emergency. Plus the goodness in you just cant help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see patients can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients has a lot to do with complaing. But not the way you think, when you are patient you dont complain at all you chill and go with the flow of things that are around you.

I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because it was so long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @NUM2 second long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. So I shut my mouth. I was glad that I was patient that day.

My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has many difficult steps, and if you one wrong, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easy stuff mostly, bat she also let me make the sauce on the last batch which was fun, and when I started to go to slow, instead of yealing at me to harry up, she asked me politely to go a little quicker which must of taken a lot of patience.

18517	7	"As  I get older my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I was six and foretaken when my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on christmas. After she said that I was angry at her and stomped to my room. I flopped hard on my bed and then eventually fell asleep. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did she said I need to have patience. Now as Im older, I know most right from attitudes, so when christmas comes I dont care about the gifts I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that I might not get alot or what I want. so now my patience is great for most things but since then I dont wanna rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might get dissapointed. Patience is a thing where if you dont have it, then things wont be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them too. Enthusiasum is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and dont want to. Enthusiasum is when you exited. People get those confused, so when a child is excited look for details and dont say be paitent say calm down because they could take it the wrong way if you dont tell them why. In conclusion these are ways I was taughht to act, so please take my words into consideration, they could help."	8	6		14				2	2	2	2			1	1	2	2

I rush to see if my @CAPS3 and sister were done yet, Are you done? I asked rudely. You could help if you want it to faster @CAPS3 answers. @CAPS4, fine Ill help, I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poop off the windows.

18538	7	"Patience in my words is to be able to wait along time for something and not angry and not raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didnt have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time to do. I think that being patiente would help you succeed in many things. For an example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive thruogh and the lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that its most likely not gonna speed up. My mom has outstanding patience because she can wait for things for hours and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience I cant wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because you must likely want get things done. Most of my family and I dont have the best patience but we sometimes do. I think that patience is very good to have."	6	12		18				1	1	2	2			3	3	3	3

18552	7	Some times when people take a long time my family is patent. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that has always waiting for. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour long bus ride to have with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load.

18553	7	"Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patients at many things. Examples of losing patients can be waiting in a line to go on a roller-coaster, because sometimes that can take forever.  Having patients can be a good thing. Your calm and you dont have to be upset at somethings like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, because those people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think that having patients will sometimes help you to suceed in life. If your un-patient than you should try not to be because the thing you want or your waiting for will eventually happen someday."	6	5		11				1	1	2	2			1	1	1	2

I had to wait a really long time. I had missed about an inning of the game already. When I was down there, there were about @NUM1 people. It was so crowded. My mom probably couldve filled three two gigabite memory cards in that time. It was so boreing. After it had been about twenty minutes they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live t.v. I was one of them. When the game was done most people walked away sad but I walked away happy and sad. People were sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy though is because I got to go onto the field."	8	9		17				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	3								
18558	7	"For some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. Patience is a big part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I pulled on my camofage and hunters orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. The moon light shone bright and I was giggling with exitment, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt I was amazed by how quite evreything was. We walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in its place. After, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. We always had tomarrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience.

The only problem, if you wanted first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it was a three and a half hour wait! @CAPS1 can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again I pleaded. @CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait! @CAPS1 quickly replied. @CAPS5! I never get what I want do I! You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over the arms. Heck you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much! well I dont wanna put somebody else throught that pain but you I might! by the time @CAPS3 were done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @CAPS3 didnt get front cart the wait wasnt even that bad."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3								
18569	7	"A time when I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class on his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didnt understand anything about it. He would put things in the wrong place, write down things that didnt go with science, and he didnt listen to anything so he was correctly but he lost it! I couldnt beleive he lost all of our hard work! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days we were almost done with it. When he was done putting the final touches on it he presented it and got an A+ on it; @CAPS1 he got an A+ on it, it made me feel so good and I got rewarded for my hard work and me being patient with him. To the end being patient makes you feel good and the person you helped feels good, too. This was a time when I was patient."	10	12		22				2	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

Sometimes its too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important. I have had to use patience many times before .Recently, I have had to use patience. I used it to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited I couldnt keep myself together. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer only untill I get out of school. I have been waiting so long I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I used to tell myself. She will be here soon. But, the days never seam to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom.

When she came out of her office I was holding my moms hand. She came unto us holding piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection.  When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about ? @NUM1. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full, I felt like a pancake under another pancake.  When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lolly pop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about @TIME1 I got to have the lollypop. That was a time when I was patient."	9	9		18				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	3

This hot girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the wast player on the team, and now that shes broke, her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and diccers us on and trys to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls hard quite a bit of practice, and I know it wont happen overnight.

Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. @CAPS1 you can get it this time. I encouraged myself. I stored at the net. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter I would be able to get my volleyball serve over. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward. Thwap!  I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I think. You got this! my entire team stared at me. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand. I will myself not even to look in the crowd. M y hand strikes the ball. It flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the  court. Since I was patient @NUM1 didnt give up, I achieved my goal.

Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't that is not good. If you do have patience that is good, but some people don't and it is not good, because if something that you have to wait for and it is important, and you have no patience that could be bad.

Due to all the ``@CAPS1 services and goods such as pizza delivery @NUM1 minute wash & dty acts people have begun to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and get nice amounts of money. Another reason people need patience is their family. If you lack patience you wont be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example I have no patience whatsoever so I cant deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old.

I didnt understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I suppose to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait.

18690	7	I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is without patience you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. One example is you wouldn't be able to wait in line. My second reason for patience being important is without it people would complaint everyday because you use patience everyday. One example is if your waiting to buy a ticket or waiting to get gas you have to wait your turn to get it. Lastly patience is important because without patience wouldn't be able to read.

I thought to myself nothing will get in my way well I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this one time I was tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival is saw this new ride. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I got in line I was ready to go on. Until, someone got infront of me. Thats when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited  as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour but, it was only @NUM1 minuets. People kept on going ahead of me. As if they did not see me, so did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a rude remark. As I was about to say the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was my turn to go on I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over I quickly went to my dad. I so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasnt so bad. Look like I can do something positive. If they thought was gonna get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they I was gonna say something."	10	12		22				3	3	2	2			3	3	3	3

There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset, or angry because it might make it even worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important.

I also have to be patient for the class assignment to passed out, for class to be over, for lunch to start, for night to come etc.I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didnt even know that means, but if Im patient Ill probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required, and people use it everyday.

If you are not patient, you will most likely arrous something up like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co- workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I just cant stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and become impatient with them and that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother but he can get really annoying, like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes I will get so mad and impatient with him I will just lose it and I always get in trouble when I beat on him and I would always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I am older and I realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a whole lot easier and fun with the people. Im around everyday and that is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get yor way, it will never happen."	7	5		12				0	2	2	3			1	1	1	2

I have been patient with kids at school that like to pic on people and tease them. I have patients some days and others that means something is going wrong and that means I dont have any more. I like having patients because it makes you get relaxed and everything. Patients is a good thing that you can have. I think patents increases your life span. Many people in the world dont have that many patients and I think that decreases your life span. I dont think if I didnt have any patients I wouldnt be in school right now cause some kids just have problems and they and dont have and they get bad grades and everything.	5	5		10				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	2

See what had happened was I got a @NUM1 @NUM3 last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it. My mom was asleep it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before. And that was the time I had to be patient.	7	8		15				1	2	2	2			2	1	2	3

Here is a major scene in the @NUM1 book. @CAPS1, @LOCATION1, are we there yet? @CAPS2 asked with curiosity @CAPS3. not yet @PERSON1 replied with a sound of fear in her voice. They were lost, really lost. Are we there yet? little @CAPS2 asked again. @CAPS3, @CAPS2, youll just have to be patient. @ORGANIZATION1  said, becoming annoyed very quickly. So the walked for hours, but still @CAPS3 sign of the castle. Little @CAPS2 was egar to meet the queen, for she had imagined the queen as a kind, patient, beautiful woman. @ORGANIZATION1 could @CAPS9 that @CAPS2 was tired, lifting her on her shoulders she said t @CAPS2, @CAPS9 if you can @CAPS9 the castle from here @CAPS2. @CAPS11 a few long patient minutes, @CAPS2 finnly saw the castle I @CAPS9 it, I @CAPS9 it! she said with a smile. Jumping off of @ORGANIZATION1s sholder, she bolted down the narrow path way. Because she had waited she was as excited as ever.

18723	7	"A time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was so nervous, so it was hard to be patient.  I waited in the waiting  soon for about fifteen minutes, then the assistant called  me in. first  she told me what she going to do,  second she  took a x-ray of my teeth , third she put metal bonds with a really strong glue on the back of my teeth, fourth @PERSON1 put the brackets on with really strong glue. Then the assistant put the wire between the brackets and metal hands, finally, she asked me what color I wanted then she put them on and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit in a dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience it was hard but I did it. That is the time I had patience."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

Its my thirteenth @DATE1 and I never wanted something more. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house we played night and day. I wanted one I wanted one really dad. The only exception was that it cost @MONEY1 and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party, all together it would be a @MONEY3 @DATE1. So my mom and I decided on an agreement @CAPS3 I pay @MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day on I asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I dont want any other presents, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the relatives come over give you your present and celebrate. I knew thats where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect I had it all planed out. Have the family party couple days after @DATE1 then go buy my @NUM1! I didnt mind waiting two or three days. I figured I would live. hey mom when are we having the family party? @DATE2. @CAPS2 that moment there was steam coming out of my ears, I could feel my face burning up like I was putting my head in a fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it out @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. @CAPS3 waiting @NUM5 days isnt patient then I dont know @CAPS1. From this day on I still havent gotten my @NUM1 but two days from now Ill be holding a stack of  cash in my hands and heading to gamertop: @CAPS3 I had to wait any longer I probably wouldnt have made it.

18725	7	"A time I was patient was at my friend cousins birthday party. I was patient because the whole intire time that we were at the party I was waiting for an answer from my parents and my friends parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited we colored a couple dinosaurs pictures, watched a movie, ate dinner, played in the basement, went in the garage and ate cake and icecream, decorated/painted our dance tool boxes, colored some more pictures, watch my friends cousin open his presents and much much more. Then it started getting dark outside so we tried to take a little map @CAPS1, it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon enough it was time for my friend to go and then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, @CAPS1 OF @CAPS2 my friends mom said not to night because my friend has a volley ball game in the @TIME1. It felt like I waited for nothing. Then I realized when your patient you get what you want more often."	9	11		20				2	3	2	2			3	3	2	3								
18726	7	"Being patient is important, as Ive learnt before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldnt get paid. @CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1s house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friends birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, cake, and ice cream. @CAPS3 could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @CAPS1 left and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 waited to play  box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I found a game that we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to part. I was frustrated at their immediately, and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide-and-seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, @CAPS3 told them that only I would count so they wouldnt fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money @CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards."	12	8		20				3	3	3	3			2	2	2	2								
18727	7	"Patience @CAPS1 is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient, if your not patient that means you are just about practicly mean because you are judging someone or makeing them do something really fast. For example if you are waiting inline for a ride at a comiville or something then if you are patient your being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you are standing in line you would be mean to other people by like saying hurry up I want to be on that ride or hurry up and start the ride allready. There is the example. If you are a patient person people will probly like you. If you are impatient then you will probly have a hard time getting along with somebody."	5	4		9				0	1	2	2			0	2	1	1								
18729	7	"There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the @CAPS1 test we had a very long time to the different parts on the test. I was always done early, so I couldnt go on to the next part. Also we couldnt talk or get out of sets. I really wanted to go on t the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Every one in the class got done early to sense we couldnt talk we just sat and weighed for testing time to be over I think every one wanted to go to the next part but we didnt no body complained or said anything we had to do this for a few day every year. Every year Im alway patient. That a story on when Im patient."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

It was hard in the begging but I was patient and I got a good grade. @NUM5 wait and donât hag and see the results of the end. Patience helped me because I know in the future to be tolerant.

I could call anyone or  listen to music. @CAPS1 heart sank. I quickly ran to @CAPS1 dad and told him about @CAPS1 problem. He first lasted and shook his head. Then grabbed @CAPS1 phone to test it. After he disconnected it did not work, his face was shocked. He then asked me how did that happen. Now at the time I was so stunned,so i couldnt figure it. Then the image of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something told me to keep this from @CAPS1 dad. I told anyway, and he laughed. I looked at him with a why are you laughing dad. He said You are going to have to wait until I get the money. @CAPS1 face was calm but here I am still waiting for the phone."	9	7		16				2	2	2	3			1	1	2	3

18741	7	"Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing. They mature and we use these life lessons & life guidences when they need them. I cant tell you how many times my mother told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, & realized how important being patient is. If your being impatient, you have to understand, that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experience this importance & knowing I had to wait, earlier in my life, it didnt mean I was content, and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a moutain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, @ORGANIZATION1 raced in it. I was crying because I was before her, &it was unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, & she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a rewardance to my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day that wether its a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run.

I am not a really patiente person but theyre lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldnt wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didnt complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you cant do it just be patient and it will pay off."	11	10		21				3	3	3	2			2	2	3	3

I ran upstairs to find out what happend and I saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost.  I showed patience by not yelling at them.

18818	7	"My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!) I whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day crawled.  I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dads car at @NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life along they hear got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums.  Passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1.(@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left.  The enormous tunnels the lines were gray and dras. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line sacrues of, if ???? up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in . I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3								
18819	7	One day I was being really patient. I was baby sitting and it was going great until the kid started fighting! It was my two little brothers of course. They were hiting kicking and the youngest one was biting; so I told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stoped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said so I said stop or youll go to your room. So he stoped and everybody was good for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home now that a whole different story. So thats the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

18823	7	Once I was taking a test it was really long. I was done early. Me and my friend waited a long time. They gave us two and half hours for the test. I finished with an hour and a half to spair. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but finished it. I had to wait another hour to actually do something. Remember bring something to do while your being patient. If you have nothing to do just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used by waiting for something or someone.	9	7		16				2	2	2	3			2	2	1	2

18825	7	"Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was every patient one day when I was ten year old. It was all because of popcorn. A small little popcorn cernal cought in my throught .That was an aginizing day, but I was very patient. One day, about two year ago when I was ten years old swallowed a popcorn cernal after going to a movie. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box then trowing the box away. Well right as soon as I and walked out the door and eaten my popcorn peice did it start to bother me. My mom and I waked in the target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn cernal. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink because of how thirsty was but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could by her things but she could not buy a pop. I understood. So I just tried not to think about it. This was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next mandd, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructer. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn cernal and lack of thirst was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away not just a few, but I didn't argue. The cernal and thirst was starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, and opened the fridge opened a bottle of water and hugged the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion we all learnt to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy."	10	11		21				2	3	2	3			2	3	3	3

They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay. But @CAPS6 there was another announcement Im sorry, but @CAPS2 cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours. @CAPS3 sounded worse, but I kept calm. My mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed. @CAPS6 four. @CAPS6 @CAPS4.

So I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldnt randomly go one @DATE1. That @DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure. She didnt have any meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free @DATE1 she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because thats better than nothing .Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for six flags.

Somehow we got into talking about dangeons and dragons, they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. anyway I kept trying too talk but I keep geting interupted so I just relaxed and waited for my turn.

Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if its a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for china. There we would see the great wall, forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldnt believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from china. BIG @CAPS2! The moment my mom tried to take her she started warning, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad odered a milk shake and he let her ??? some of it that was also a @CAPS2. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a rollarcoaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dads dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is.

I had to stay patient if i wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was exited to ride the rollar coster so I stayed in line.

Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much furthur than that, you must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether youre a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, @CAPS2, dont do it again. @CAPS3 that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and dont make those mistakes again.

He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with downs syndrom. This basically means she doesnt understand things as fast as you and I. You also can see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would give up and leave because she doesnt get it, but her closest friends have developed patient like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important lifeskills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you."	8	9		17				2	2	2	2			0	3	3	3

I believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you dont have the time to do something then you dont have the time to live. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldnt be here right now. I believe that patience @CAPS5 more than just its deffinition. I believe that it means to be able to a low time to pass so you can do something. If all you did was work then good have a pretty boring life. For example if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for @CAPS6 elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise she probably wouldnt be a teacher. Another example would be that lets say your on @NUM1 and your going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic @CAPS5 holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile up. and you  honk your horn. Thats not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing @CAPS5 perfect when your honk but it doesnt make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9. @CAPS10 @CAPS5 pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesnt make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11.

18924	7	"I think patience comes into role in a lot of places. For example you have to be patient to get a job or else the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Another place you would have to be patient to be successful. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, thats not patience. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it. Lastly if you have to wait for it not get it right away, if you money from your job you dont just go rob the place you have to be patient and you have to wait."	6	4		10				0	2	2	2			0	1	2	1

Now dont get me wrong, I understand why we take the @CAPS1, touh, I think its to help us learn, or make our hands hurt and cramp up, I dont know, really. Writing about patience is very hard because you can lose it very fast. But the @CAPS1 is the @CAPS1, and I think to so my best, so the story must go on! Its very quiet in here, and the smell of pencil and paper are very long. My eyes are tired, and I cant help but to let out a mighty roar of a yawn. My hand is asleep and every second, you hear a sniff, sniff, sniff sniff, snot. Were not aloud to get up, so were stuck sniff, sniff, snot-ing  all hour long. When you were a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or a section of it? Well, its none of my business, never mind. Ou! My hand really hurts! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there, thats better. Patience is a virtue, but who cares.

It could take days, months, or even a year to get this skill but I just have to wait until the day my body will do the skill he said. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no result of getting my new skill. Finally after four months of doing this I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over.

Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didnt care too, too much. So I lived in @LOCATION4, went to kindergarden, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to @LOCATION3. Well, now I wasnt four anymore.  I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didnt hate the idea but I didnt love it either. Of course. It didnt exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didnt want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good .There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with which I now hang out with everyday. Ive slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal.  I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in @LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year.

18973	7	Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin wanted to go home and her mom was being and said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think that patient will help you go through life. For an example if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we have to do. If you be patient you could do things much better. You have to sometime wait for mangers to call you to get the next job applied for. But can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient.	6	6		12				1	1	2	2			1	1	2	2

What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except we were complaining, and @CAPS1 parents were starting to get irritated we finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic  line! Yov what fun! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detects and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side we got to sit down. We all got of the ferry and looked up at lady liberty. It was actually really dig unfartunately they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. @CAPS4 well it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live  @CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of way self for not complaining.

There were so many girls trying out that I was nervous for what team I was going to get on or if I even would make a team. So I worked  my hardest and figured, I had had experience from the other teams I was on before and I was now confident I would make the team. After @NUM2 of tryouts they had grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, according to your skill level. We got a letter that afternoon, and I made it into the A team! We then got right into practice and games. Winning most of the games, and improving on working as a team. Then a couple days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As northern middle school, w obviously were rivals and were determined to beat them. For bragging rigts,we joked, but most important because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won, and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving all around the court. I   felt very confident, in the second game also, even though I didnt play as much as I wished. I still had fun! In the game of volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match. The best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time we had won both of the games, which ment we won, however we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the match our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2! Pretend like its the winning point, and play your hardest, she would say. So as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited till about half of the game and wondered when I would be in. Time had gone by and I was getting discoureged because I hadnt played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in or not, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat, and about I point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, can you do it?I shot right up and subbed in. I whent to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! i had made the winning point! In the end I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! But boy did I have a great time serving the winning point. It really tought me a lesson!"	10	12		22				3	2	3	2			3	3	3	3

She started with her homework first because are she had was a math work shect ?? @NUM1 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were ?? addition and subtracts. That took her @NUM2 minutes, (@NUM3 on each side) which isnt that bad. Next she did the chores.

Now , we go to her room. Ally messy room you first couldnt open the door. So she had to tog on the door until she could finally fit her self in. The door slammer shut from all the clothes but luckily didnt wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a check list of what she needed to do she had to: vacuum, fix her bed , and put all the food away that were in her room back in the kitchen. That took about @NUM5 hour and a half. So in all thats been about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she had to do clean up the rest of the dinner.  Her mom couldnt because she had to drop off her dad at the air part for work, so @CAPS2 was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had speghettl for dinner and her sister spilled the house all over the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @NUM7 minutes, mopped which took like @NUM4 minutes, when she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park.

When you wait you also show care that you know someones in front of you and you wait wait wait til its your turn cause waiting and being patient lets you absorve the things around you and look at things you never seen before in your whole life and stuay what you saw to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradatude to the person in front of you and gradatude shows respect and trust wortiness thats a way of being polite and patience to the person in front of you. When you patience you dont have to rush anything cause you have a lot of time and you shouldnt complaine at all when you are or are trying to be patient no matter how long your patient the maximum time is for you and you bring up that time faster by not being patient and patient is a big thing cause patient gives you want you want or need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you never know whos patient to you so you should be patient to someone else.	4	3		7				0	1	2	1			0	1	1	1

You ask your parents, when and they say, soon just have some patience! well this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was the same way, but just then, I remembered my goal about being a mature teenager and patient. So I carried on with my normal, everyday life. Eat breakfast, comb hair, get dressed, brush teeth, and go to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad will arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So I sat on my chair, in my room and watched the clock tic and toc for about @NUM2 minutes. Then, I walked in to the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting and waited till I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my dads truck. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door as I simply walked to see the puppy. aww! everyone screamed. @CAPS1 I hold her, and shes my dog, and lets name her also came in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing their quietly and handled me the dog. you are being so patient, you @CAPS1 be the one to hold her first! I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one that got to hold her first. Being patient @CAPS1 pay off!"	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

When we where shoveling it was hard become we had to got through lots of snow just  to got to a nice layer of snow to put lots of water on it. I am not patient gye when. We do something for hours to get it fully done. But I kept telling myself to just be patient. The only reason I was losing my patients was because it was getting dark and I has to go soon. But before I became unpatient we got it done and I was so happy we got the icy trail done. It was tough because we also had to wait for the water to turn into ice but that didnt bother me at all.

Because you cant push or shuvie your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means you cant do or get what ever you want unless you truble.

My mom replied ""let's take her to the park she will have fun there!"" I agreed and off we went. If noticed @CAPS1 likes to do things herself. She insisted on getting in her car seat done, getting on the swings and putting together puzzles. That requires a ton of patience because she takes forever.

19061	7	"This is a story about patience. Patience is needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you need patience. One reason is if someone or something   gets you mad, you need patience or you can get in trouble. For example if you get mad because of someone and you start a fight, youll get in huge trouble. Or if you try doing something and you cant, you need patience or you can break something and get in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so you dont hurt their feelings if they cant do something right. They might get mad and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you, you need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both dont get in trouble. If you wouldnt have patience, things could end drastically.so that is why you should have patience. Without patience you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. Thats why you need patience."	8	7		15				0	2	3	3			0	2	2	3

Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my @LOCATION2s house. She lives about @NUM1 hours away, near @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves when family visits, so we dont mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. Ive had to have been there at least @NUM2 times in my life time. My mom works the night shift at a well known hardware store. Usually, she works @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. So when she gets off work we would pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time I sleep. One time, I had drank lots of pop and was very hyper. I was annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 and started acting like an idiot, singing along to the songs. Until, my @CAPS3 died. I felt my heart break a little. I couldnt fall asleep now. I was still hyper. I started listening to the radio, but all we could listen to was country. Since, we were going @CAPS7, we were traveling away from the control tower of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached, The up @CAPS7 store where we always stop to get gas and food when we go to @LOCATION2s. I got @CAPS8 and even more pop. I gave a tiny evil laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished my food and was bored once again. There was nothing to do in that car. I was angry at that point. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the drive way, and my @LOCATION2 running to come greet us. Finally, we were there. I had survived yet another, ride to @LOCATION2s house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, Im almost positive will never stop getting bored during the ride.

He taught me my back handspring, the first trick I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesnt. I am happy he is patient but sometimes he is too patient. Sometimes I would rather have him push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad. I always give it my all when I feel like that. It is an amazing feeling when you get it for him. @CAPS1 I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic try again, it was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was going to get this! As I ran and jumped everything was good. I did the trick, and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me, @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didnt stick it. We kept working and eventually I got it!

A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. @CAPS1 was the @DATE1 time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad had told me that you needed turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devestated that @CAPS1 wasnt easy, I gave up a little bit after. Now, though, my mom gently persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, turn! Turn! but @CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the grass. @CAPS1s okay. You almost had @CAPS1! mom said rushing over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I tried to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up. On my one last try before @CAPS1 was time to go back in the house, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed patience that day. She didnt let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!"	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

19112	7	"Patience you should have patience to whatever it cames to. If you dont have patience here are somethings that can happen, once my sisters firend was wanting to cross the rode and she didnt want to wait so she didnt look both ways and a car was caming and she ran out in frot of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and rode burn all over she was took to the hispoteli where me and my sister and mom went to go see her the day of the acciecd. She was all cut up and couldnt really walk. She had so much cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after she got hit she went the docthers because she kept getting really bad head acts. They said she had something called coma atices like she had a lilttlel coma. So thats what happens when you dont have patience even over something so samll like crossing the road you have to patience for that to. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows up and have the air on. So I did I was getting really bored and I was about to get out but then I seen to guys trying to open a car window. So I garbed my cell phone and went to the back and sat down on the gorond and called @NUM1. They were on the way they were in the drive way. Now they got out of there cars and ran over to the guys and get them, they soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they been looking for so I got a money awared for catching them. The money awared was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not geting out of the car got me money. Saved my live because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So something patience can save lifes and help find bad guys you never know what you could get from having patiences, so thats my story about have patienes and what they can gave you.

Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didnt help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep that was needed.

So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you dont have to wait as long. That means you can get and go. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview. One good thing patience can get you to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if your all prep you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect. Its like treating things like dirt. Patience is sort of like table manners, nice and proffessional. If I were you go patient it leads you to a good future."	7	6		13				1	0	3	3			1	1	2	2								
19139	7	"Patient is very important if there were no patience everyone would be irritated all the time. if there were no patience we wouldn`t be able to get through the day we would be constantly looking at the clock thinking when am I going to get out. Some people have no patience and others havetons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other no patience could affect the littlest things we are all fighting because we had to wait in line at a store, or have to count money. It could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can summarize that right now it is more than waiting it`s being acceptive of something you don`t like. It`s also going threw life without saying why can`t I do what or you can`t because I can`t. The world wouldn`t be the way it is without patience."	5	6		11				0	1	2	2			0	1	2	3

I was walking into the room where the speech competition was. I sat next to all my friends and the all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends he said that he had just alittle bit to much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didnt know what he was doing. @CAPS2 one actually knew that he and I were friends.

Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, @CAPS2 way why would I be friends with him? then @CAPS1 laughed. We both looked at eachother, in a bad way. After a few days we wont talking to each other since @CAPS1 was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But ofcourse, @ORGANIZATION1 wasnt patient at all. He was eager to tell @CAPS1 that me and him were friends but we couldnt tell anyone because to them were both different, but the truth is that were both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basket ball, music and talking like @NUM1. Haha! Soon @CAPS1 found out. @ORGANIZATION1 had gone and told @CAPS1 that we were friends. Turns out @CAPS2 one laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ORGANIZATION1 had @CAPS2 patience and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and @ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will be best friends forever!

Being patient is respectful to others and others will be your friend. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being respectful when you dont wait your turn. @CAPS1 when you to do something which your mom and dad are speaking to another adult @CAPS1 rouged to rush things when other people dont want to do something with you. Or nagging to leave somewhere like a aunts or uncles house. @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when you dont wait. Be respectful and wait its a better way to make friends.

19145	7	"Have you ever babysitted little kids? If you have, then you know how much patience it requires. It was my little cousins third birthday party, and as the oldest child, it was my responsibility to watch the younger kids. At first, everything was going fine. The kids were quietly playing with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started to play with the ball popper. Of course, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately stop what theyre doing and go play with the toy, too. So all of the little kids gathered around the ball pepper, giggling with delight as the machine spot plastic balls out into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball from the air, causing the other kids to fight over the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and kept fighting, I realized that this would require a lot of patience. I calmly took the ball popper away and waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball pepper quietly.

Seconds pass by like hours your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies are the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him staring at his perfect head. @DATE2 @CAPS1 the girlâs choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. â@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.â I chickened out, no way could I give it to him myself so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to @CAPS3 @PERSON3 (who @CAPS1 @PERSON1âs friend) to @CAPS3 @CAPS2, (@PERSON1âs better friend) to @CAPS3 @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2 but, now he knows, and now itâs @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience @CAPS1 my essence I remind myself donât be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasnât because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment finally I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little to patient seeing today @CAPS1 @DATE2 and the dance @CAPS1 tonight. At my locker, which @CAPS1 four and a doorway down from @PERSON1âs I have a note taped to it. It reads â@CAPS3 me your phone number and Iâll call you for the @NUM1.â. Gosh! Boys are so confusing I @CAPS3 him my number and wait by the phone. I think heâs testing my patience I wait for what feels like hours by my phone willing to ring. I felt like breaking down, giving up, and then a rush of will power would come back and @CAPS3 me it would be worth it in the end. The phone didnât ring for what seemed like an eternity, so when it finally did I thought I was imagining it.â When I answered all my patience paid off! He said one word.

Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and told us the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally the doctor came with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes he did come right back.

I did try to make it rush by, but it didnt work. I had been off of school now for @NUM1 weeks and I had did everything I wanted to do. When me my mom, sister and friends go we always have a lot of fun (of corce). Every night since , I have known we are going to cedar point I would sit there and think one day when many kids would ask and complain to there mom saying,  cant it come anymore, but me never, not one I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited did my chores, packed and watched tv. Trust me it was very long, very boring and is itching at me to complain but I didnt. I took a deep breath every time, this would happen to me. And say only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to cedar point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and do while waiting for cedar point to come along. This is what patient is to me, and in my life.

It took everything I had to not go looking for him, but I knew I couldnt just go running off I had to be very patient.

Finally we where done with the lines no more for a white. So I open my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room it was amazing.

She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward ''oh, hi @CAPS2!'' she exclaimed and smiled kindly. ''I have to finish my homework and eat. ''I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and swang back and forth. An hour went by. I patiently sat there. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late I could come back tomorrow, through. That was a time I was patient."	11	12		23				3	3	2	3			3	3	3	3

My mom and I went hunting with @PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck could come. It was very cold and l was dressed warm but I was still could. There was a little heater in the shead thing we were in. we couldn't complain being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining that was good. When l was about to ask if we could go in a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the doer to come closer. @PERSON1 loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran of. Purted shot! We got out of the shead and searched for a blood trial. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was wroth it. The right way to be patient, shuting your mouth, not wining and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient.

When we finally made it to the @ORGANIZATION1 market we had to stand in line for about @NUM3 mins. I told my mum Im ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being inpatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors it took them almost two hours just to call her name. then it take another @NUM4 to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines.

There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out its ok, I heard its an awesome ride lets just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didnt know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours.

I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point but you are still important to them team, youre time will come. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game the carman  @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing not fouled (I didnt even see it, truth be told Im not even sure if it happen but you cant argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! Im surprised her shot wasnt took. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didnt say anything. I just stood nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) she didnt make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself ,I felt really happy for myself. Im just now realizing that, that whole time I was standing there is didnt a face, or say anything or think something in my head! I was just standing tall for the first minding my own business and untelling to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now bar out) I just assumed the box out position. Sit down, but down hands out and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opposite!

The whole time I was on the side lines. Never went in not ounce. I was very patient. Not to say I wasnt mad. At least I got some exercise standing there. The whole time I suported my team mates. I encouraged. I help in any way shape or form. I listend to them complain. But I did give suport. There I was so mad I could have killed. I was ready but my coach said no. It has my time to shine.

19247	7	In my opinion being patient is when your waiting your turn for some thing. And being impatient means not writing your turn. In your whole life you have patientence because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience to. I was raised to have patience when your doing something dont rush because you can mess up. Dont go way to slow because then people will think you dont know how to do it. You can just go at your paste so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who dont have patience arent always happy all the time.	5	8		13				0	1	2	2			2	2	2	2

So I waited and then @DATE2 finally came, more months passed and i still hadnt heard from my uncle. I began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. I told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. I was thinking in my haad A little its been almost a year! Then on @DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion.Then he told me he knows that I thought he forgot about the phone. I  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldnt have forgotten about. Soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @CAPS2 touch to me. I was so excited I just had to jump up and give a hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon.

On the way home one bentt traler tire popod ahead five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasent. We stopped and whent out to look at the tire. We didnt have a spare so we drove home on our rim. that is the most patient I have ever been. To @CAPS2 this writing sample she could have explaned what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also she could stop useing  I to start most of her sentences. That  would make it more  instening. In the third sentence she put were instead of was. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I dont know I she ment @TIME1. or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m. It would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those this would be a good sample."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2								
19257	7	When I was patient I was sitting at a restront. And I ordered my drink and mike was the first one. Then when we got our food they said it will take about five more minutes so I sat there it was fifteen minutes later when she came back and made the wrong food so I was losing my patients. so then I just relaxed. She came back with my meal thes time it was. The right one so I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast so when I was done they gave me a free descont because of the mixup they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such great patient`s I had. And thats when I was very patient.	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

19259	7	"Patience is a hard thing to have, but there is rewards to having it. I had a teacher that no one could remember to gave us our report card in band class. So after a few weeks I made a bet with him that if he didnt bring us our report card the next day he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally. It was the end of the year. And he still didnt have them. Once schools started up again and we were half way through the school year and mey band teacher walks in and gives me two packs of swittles.

It take patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @DATE2 and @DATE1 I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice to @CAPS1 go to the games, but I have patience. So I go. It is very boring to just sit there but I do it so I can watch and play @CAPS2 year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isnt when your sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting."	9	9		18				2	2	2	3			2	2	2	3								
19261	7	"The one time when I was paitent was on the @CAPS1 of last year. Some of the reasons how I was paicent was by keeping to myself or as you know it being quiet. The @CAPS1 is not that hard but when you have to have paitence thats when it gets hard to you, and me. Pacents is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But lets get back on track shall we. On the @CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait for your class mates to be done. So in that spare time you can read a book or check over your work. Pacents is also important because when you taking the @CAPS1 you cant rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. Thats where pacents comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the @CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today the reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom dont have pacents you are most likly to fail the @CAPS1. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if every body in the room and is being silent than you can and will do good. When I have the @CAPS1 @CAPS8 pacent when I am done because I care about other peoples work habbits with the @CAPS1. I understand that you dont have the @CAPS1 no more but it is being pacient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had pacients!

19266	7	"Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between, I can be patient at times, @CAPS1 at other times Im not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year Im not that patient, and every year we go to @LOCATION1. We go @LOCATION1 for labor day, to walk the bridge. The rule is, if you dont  complain you get fudge. I thought I wasnt gonna get fudge, because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before embers burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge I had to be patient. So I got dressed, walked to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the mighty walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge walking time and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I told myself be patient over and over and then I sped up going past the first three miles in @NUM1 minutes, (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat out record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could and my legs felt like @CAPS3 were ready to burst! I couldnt do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @CAPS1 my legs kept telling me @CAPS2! @CAPS3 wouldnt let me stop, @CAPS3 were: tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line not only to get fudge, @CAPS1 also to beat our record. Thanks to patience I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. Thats a time Ill never forget, because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. Thats how I was patient, and Im glad I was patient with my legs. Im not very patient so thank goodness for patience!"	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

Imedetly after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later came back with a hot cup of tea and @ORGANIZATION1 said I made mama make you some tea. That was hart warming @CAPS9 me. After I drank it @ORGANIZATION1 asked if I felt better. I said a little then @ORGANIZATION1 got @CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and new that she didnt fully understand yet. So I got @CAPS3 and took her @CAPS9 the ice-cream shop @CAPS9 get some ice-cream. @ORGANIZATION1 was happe ans that made me happe.

One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked @CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up? @CAPS2 responded with patience and years of practice. The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom @CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later? @CAPS2 replies @CAPS4, @CAPS9? I answered @CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with. @CAPS6. @CAPS2 says. When we get there, therere @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didnt go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said @CAPS8, I know youll catch on soon! and I wondered out loud @CAPS9?, @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self."	12	10		22				3	3	3	3			2	3	3	2

Its not that long. @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. @CAPS5 about @CAPS6 play a game? @CAPS6 continued a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied!

I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point- the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to music and stare out the window, this car ride was turning into forever. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work hack, doing things in order. This I didnt mind since we went on mostly big rollar coasters with a few acceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how mad, fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since  the line was nearly an hour and a half long. I guess that the line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to the ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic.

19302	7	Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or giving up about waiting and that patient. An example of being patienc is lets say your standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now waiting @NUM1 hours in line is being patient to get the tickets. While out complaing or anything. Being patient is very respectful to yourself and others around you. But I also think that everyone could use a little patience. I think that people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didnt have patience the world would be a crazy mess. Example: @CAPS1 one would be waiting these too. Everyone would waiting be first. It could just be crazy. So Im happy that there is patience in this world and people have it.	7	4		11				0	2	2	3			0	1	1	2

19304	7	"This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I did not have the @NUM1 write then and there my mom did not complain she waited she had patience. Patience does not mean you keep beging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait on that pizza. When you have patience people will have patience with you. For example if you was waching tv and you did not want to get up yet people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does   not mean you keep asking. For example I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 beging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience a waited on her answer I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my stor and what patience mean to me."	6	4		10				1	1	2	2			1	1	1	1

One example of this might be if someone else is fixing something for you and you really waited them to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it is the type of thing that takes time, maybe a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it will not be a person you wait for, but an inamate object, like a television show, which can not be rushed, even though sometimes you want to ruch it. With a human however, if you rush them to do something, (which can happen it @MONTH1 end up being not as good and even breaking in about ten seconds after them doing it, it @MONTH1 end up happening faster though. You might also waight for nature too, such as a sunny day. When it @MONTH1 have been raining for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during storm. It, for me, have really wanted the power to come back on during a storm because there is nothing to do!!!

Wait here and dont touch anything. @CAPS1 said. So I sat here cold bored and hangry waiting for what seemed like hours. Finaly my @CAPS1 got back and told me it might be another @NUM1. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while. After we got some food we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A fork lift driver not somehow managed to get his fork lift stuck in the trailer. Thats when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out and then all heard was hollers and screams. FINALY! After my @CAPS1 yelled a bit we finally got back on the road.

It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boy friend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patients got me a now hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice areana I was playing at. Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1? I asked wondering if it would easy to get it. @CAPS2 buddy we just ran out. @CAPS3 the sales man giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick. I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No luck. I guess Ill have to order it online. I thought to myself. The delivery didnt grive  quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive.

But in between we have some breaks and days off, I think we yet have enough assignments throughout the years, start we go school @NUM2 days a week. School can be really fun sometimes, @CAPS1 example, I wait until field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so principal doesnt take our privellages away, @CAPS1 example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, shell take it away from us.

All of things combined to make our pleasant ride through the mountains, a rollercoaster ride that I will never in a moment ever forget. The whole time I was thinking to myself.""I 'm going to go insane! Just make it stop.

19357	7	"Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boreing . There were a lot of people in line that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and get the tickets, I didnt because that would berude. I felt that helped me develop my patients a little bit more. Plus I would not want people cutting in flont of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait."	8	8		16				2	2	2	2			2	2	2	2

19359	7	"There were many times when I was patience. Maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your home work. Maybe waiting days for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. @MONTH1 be waiting days for your teachers to come and give your tests back. But today I am going to talk about when I had to be patience to get my first dog. @CAPS1 was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We couldnt find the right one. @CAPS1 took @NUM1 weeks til we saw the cutest chichuacua. He was only one year old. We were rushing through the papers scared some one else was planning to adopt him. When we turned @CAPS1 in the lady said we had a back side too. After the paper work we had to wait another week because they had  to fix him. My mom went shopping for dog store they told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @DATE2 we thought we could pick him up on @DATE1. On that @DATE1 we picked him up @CAPS1 took @NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @NUM3 years for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog.We didnt find one, but we waited and if your patient you will get something for that. We are still patient to maybe get another dog if our parents allow @CAPS1."	9	12		21				2	2	2	3			3	3	3	3								
19360	7	"I am   patient   at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teachers or someone else is busy I will wait for however long. I need to, until   they are alone helping someone else. In   any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay and I was behind a little because, I had in finish my project that was due the week before, so when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remeber from the art teachers demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up, they said, yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I wailed, it took about the whole hour but, I wailed and was patient with them. At the end   of the hour they still waent done so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, Id see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me and when she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but, I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. Thats not the only time but, its the most longest time I was patient with some one."	10	8		18				3	3	2	2			2	2	2	2

I just dont try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatience I am is Im at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars I wont save up for the ten dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy candys. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I cant spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because it dont want to and until they give it back most the time that happened. I get grounded but item worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom say no I always sneak it and get in trouble. @NUM1 words."	9	7		16				2	2	2	3			1	2	2	2

I didnt want to go because it was after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled out the information then we sat. In the middle, we start to watch television. I was really bored because it was nothing on but informercials. They had us waiting fo over an hour. I start to get hungry and very upset.

I got my shots which took a very long time, I was frustrated, I got my shots, before we left they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we got @CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots. The information I got was just as painful as getting my shots. They had us wait for a very long time.

I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didnt want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldnt! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didnt think about it, time would fly by again.

I still remeber the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and l couldnt think l could make it because l admit to be a very impatient person.

All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers just cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient she just stood their standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few minutes. I left to go on some rides and when I came back the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say anything. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldnt stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl I would of lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldnt believe my eyes she didnt even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing!

A lot of people have patient but some people just don`t have manner when they just don`t care and start the yell and screaming. Like popstars a lot of singers popstar and other famous people think they can cut in front of any one cause their rich but it they wern`t rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars just need to have patient.

You wait until you get to the top, then you splash down a hill. Well, that was one of everyones favorite rides, so there was a long line. We had to wait for a half hour to ride it once.

19395	7	"Patience is the ability to be tolerant,understanding and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isnt  something they teach you in my school. There isnt a book your assigned to read called  patience @NUM1,there is no movie called patience is the key. Non of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and its not at all wat  i had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold bench next to  the strength meter at a county fair. What people really dont understand is the patience that is put in to being a spy. Sure theres an ocasional car being blown up bet  not today, not for me. I here the clock in my hand so tick,tock,tick,tock. @CAPS3  @CAPS2, theres come action. The subject (the person Im assigned to watch is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is bay a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodlle a design in the dirt, with my foot. Im just about to abort the mission. Seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with finger print revealing mist. A purple fluffy cloud of vapor sorround the chip. Sure enough when the purple cloud vanishes. I see that the subjects fingerprints are on the chip, I pull out my laptop at insert the computer chip. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if Im able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but a tablecloth, Im sure I can sit here and just be patient.  At least twenty minutes have gone by now but i feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 wassucsessful. @CAPS2! I say aloud and people start to stare, but I dont mind. I click the square on the screen that says open. @CAPS3 a small message opens up that says @CAPS4 me at the ice cream pallor. I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone , and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf diaped over her head are the only two people standing by the icecream stand. I walk a little bit closer and i realise that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars they were both in handcaffs ofcoure, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to sucsesfully complete  my mission without being  patient."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

I told her to be patient and it would fill like time is going faster .She said, she is going to try, but if it didnt work were leaving. She waited patiently and next thing you know the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle then he came back in the room and said I found it. It was in the other doctor  room above the sink on the dresser, after  I got my shot the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. after he thanked me he gave me he gave me a sucker and shook my hand.

We were in the back of the whole part, called The dead zone, it was very terrifying but fun all at the same time. What a weird feeling.

We finally got to the top floor and can you belive it, we still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but not for long. Then we looked over and realized how far up we were, and started to talk about how scary it would be to fell. Then we went on and on talking.

19467	7	"I think that patience is about waiting instead of rushing things .If you be patient things will actually come faster than you think for example if you want something and you have to wait in line instead of running off and finding  something else at and wait it will always help. Be patient with what even your doing just be patience even if its waiting run school to be even. If your waiting for a same at stem to come sat have patience a wait because it might keep you out of trouble.

19470	7	"There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, than you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept telling everyone else to burry up its distracting. Now that youve interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they @MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell over and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return.  My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient can get hurt. Lets say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly but they were walking down the stairs very slow, so you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten"	9	6		15				2	2	2	3			1	1	2	2

19502	7	"Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and youd have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you have the urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have a orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake sampling station, and cookies, and domus, and all these good cake. But first, I must suffer through playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play and watching at honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so any annoying can laugh at it and call me an epicfail. But I still live. Playing the piece isnt so bad, its just some pieces of paper with notes and watching the beginners might is torture, but at least I dont have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all.  Who says Im going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at like @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. Im not really looking forward to this years @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross-country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping Im not going to get any homework. But if I do, Ill just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. Ill have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can live. All that is on my mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly."	12	12		24				3	3	3	3			3	3	3	3

It was the next day already and I still couldnt wait. During the long ride I fell asleep when I had woke up, we were already there.

A couple years ago, I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we were there, she asked if I wanted to come in. thinking about all of the reasons why I dont, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. I was sweating within ten minutes waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasnt out of the store. There was so many times where I wanted to be angry, but I didnt let myself get this way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out, I wasnt mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies why she was late. Most of the time I am not a patience person.

But there is two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates the by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more!

Finally, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paper work, said that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didnt sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2.

This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the fullers. @CAPS12, @CAPS2s mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 countys only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. @CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you! @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mothers red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown, @CAPS12, why dont you play with little @PERSON4? @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting little @PERSON4 in her arms, actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when theyve asked to play one for the billionth time. @CAPS2 we need to talk. @CAPS21 the middle aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side, honey, youve got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog! @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4.

At first I didn't know she was a grouch i just thought she didn't like me or something.When @PERSON2 told me his mom was a grouch I started to laugh and laugh. He asked me what was so funny i told him that i thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I see his mom I would smile at her and all she will do is frown and walk away. That made my friend laugh we were cracking up so hard that we got in trouble in class.   The next day @PERSON2 and I were eating lunch at school when he says to me &lt;hey your pretty good at making people laugh&gt;. I said &lt;no I am not my jokesare horrible&gt;. He said &lt;@CAPS1 lets put them to the test go up to some one new to this school&gt;. I said @CAPS1 so we went around the whole school looking for a new student unfortunately we couldn't find one we heard the bell ring and we ran to our class. We sat in the back of the classroom its only @PERSON2 and I and anempty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @PERSON1 got the front of the room andclass today I have an announcement we have a new student in our class say hello to @LOCATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @PERSON1 told @ORGANIZATION1 shecould sit in the back in between @PERSON2 and I. She sat down turned to the both of us and said hello. @PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell her the joke and @CAPS3 him a thumbs up. I turned to @LOCATION1 and said hi I'm @CAPS4 do you want to hear a joke. @ORGANIZATION1 said yeah sure. I started &lt;@CAPS5 knockshe said &lt;who's thereI said &lt;booshe said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't get it but duringthe middle of the movie she said &lt;ohhhh I get itand she started to laugh. @PERSON2 turned to me and said &lt;I told you so&gt;.   @PERSON2 got this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his house that I could make his mom laugh or at least make her smile. I said &lt;@CAPS1 sounds like a plan&gt;. I asked mt mom if it was @CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @PERSON2 house she said &lt;yeah just make sure its @CAPS1 with his mom&gt;. @PERSON2 asked his mom she said it was @CAPS1. When I got to @PERSON2 house the first thing we did was play video games. When it was dinner time we all sat down at the table to eat @PERSON2 and I were on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @PERSON2 told me to tell the joke to his parents i said @CAPS1. So I said to them &lt;@CAPS5 @CAPS5&gt;they replied &lt;who's thereI said &lt;boothey said &lt;boo who?I said &lt;oh don't cry I am right here&gt;. His parents started to laugh and laugh and they keptlaughing for like five minutes. @PERSON2 turned to me and yelled it worked his mom asked what worked. @PERSON2 explained everything to them. His mom told usthat her mom had recently died and that's why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning when my mom came to pick me up she asked me how the sleep over went. I said it was fun I made people laugh. She said @CAPS1 but laughter isn't going to help you clean your roomall i could say was gosh darn it.             FIN	18	16		34				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	3	3						
20717	8	" Softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @CAPS2. Although I love softball I feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when I had the opportunity to play on a top notch team I looked forward to all the many more memories I would have.  Hood @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was my team name, I had played almost four years with this local team. Many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. I felt like I had my set team, I was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year now approached I was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe I play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. I now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team I knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team I knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. As I looked at the pros and cons of both teams I decided no; I would stay with the team that I knew so well and I would stay comfortable at where I was at. At that point softball was just around the corner and I began to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. I then decided I would take a chance and try for this team.  As my dad and I drove to the field where I would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. I wanted this team to like me, I was playing all the possible ways in my head I could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. The time moved quickly and I wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. I was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said ""ready or not here we come"". Nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was second guessing every move I made, I even had troubles removing my seat belt.  As I approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by I saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; that was it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with the @CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. Then as I walked onto the field they all grew a smile. Each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. I found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I now had made new friends, friends I knew I would grow close with. My year with this team was amazing I have friendships with these girls that I never would have discovered if I hadn't gone. Those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a very big role in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone and tried out, and had I not had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @CAPS2. I have had great memories with the @CAPS2, but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships; therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people."	21	26	46	46				5	4	5	4	4	4	6	5	6	6	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4
20718	8	" Some people like making people laugh, I love it. I will do most anything to get a good laugh. I will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). When I was little I didn't really understand laughter. For some odd reason I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. I was kind of ""special"" in some areas as a kid (I still am today). Still at the tender age of five I loved making people laugh, and being special I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Mind you I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. For example one time I hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time I was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. One of the craziest times though was a couple days before I had to take pictures and I wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how ""special"" I was (I got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. The expert persuasive kid I was back then convinced her to let me go outside. Before I could even reach the street I fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. Although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  Now that you know that I love making people laugh, I'm ""special"", and that I'm a complete spaz I can get on with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and I loved school because I got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. Surprisingly I have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. He would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which I think is odd. Anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day I got a wedgies). That day is what this whole story is about, it's why I told you I love making people laugh, why I told you I'm ""special"", and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. It started out like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. When I got to school I grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. I did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). It came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. When we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. We were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when I would get into the story and lose my guard I would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. The story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. The story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. I cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a ""special"" spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. I remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. It took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  To this day I still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course I can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, I'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. It was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me grow into a better person, I can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember, being ""special"" could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh."	15	20	40	40				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20719	8	" ""LAUGHTER""  @CAPS1 I hang out with my friends, the one thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh about is running into trash cans, laundry or maybe even about what we ate for dinner the @TIME1 before. @CAPS1 I am usual stressed out the one thing I love is to hangout with my friends. they usual are good listeners. overall. Though they take your mind off things. So with my friends you can count on having a great time no matter what the occasion is.    @CAPS1 I say trash can I really mean trash cans I remember this one time in the hall way at school my friend was hanging on to my back pack because she tends to loose me in the hall way a lot because I walk a lot faster then her, anyways the class bell had just rouge an all the student were heading to lunch we were. I was just getting ready to cross the hall way an she said don't do it, so I did an nobody stopped! so she kinda slide into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hall way, she @MONTH1 have knocked it off but I can't really say? I was still walking an the sound effects were so funny I laugh at it still.       My friend an I have a inside joke? we went out to lunch together. @CAPS1 we saw a laundry mate an I minds went crazy, we made up a funny joke an said that we should make our self's aprons with lots color and rhinestones, so that way if we wanted to get all of our laundry done at the same time. We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS1 our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.  Now about the food its sort of like the laundry but I guess better? I remember @CAPS1 i came to school the next day i just started talking about what i had for dinner @TIME1 i think at that time my mom had asked us if we wanted chicken @PERSON1 an my sister as i screamed an said hell yeah? so dinner was ready an @CAPS1 we went to go site at the table we looked at it an it was not what we expected it to be? it was frozen out of a box an it looked like somebody had eaten the food than puked it back up? it was that great looking.    All of these thing that have named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @CAPS1 there not drama i love my friend I don't think I could have asked for a better one because all we do is laugh an have fun an fun in to trash can locker an whatever else there is but the one thing that matter the most with my one friend is that @CAPS1 we get in to a fight we can not stay mad at each other well I now that I can't. So at the end of the day I ask her are we done being made at each other? an than we just look at each other an laugh because that about all we can do because the reason was so stupid there was really no need for it.that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us. but just to have fun an be silly. not anybody else but are self's an sometime @CAPS1 we have are really goofy days? we make up the story about our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than to laugh because deep down inside you an your friend will look back an say wow those where the best day was @CAPS1-would would get in trouble in class for talking way to much.

20722	8	"@CAPS3 I'm going to tell @CAPS18 a little story. I remember a time when @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I decided to make a snowman at @CAPS11 house in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I say to him," I'm bored, @CAPS1 do @CAPS18 want to do?" @PERSON1 replies,"@CAPS2 go make a snowman." @CAPS3 I agree that that would be fun. @CAPS34 starts reaching for a jacket @CAPS3 gloves, but I stop him @CAPS3 say," @CAPS1 are @CAPS18 getting those for?" "@CAPS5's not cold @CAPS20." "@CAPS6," replies @PERSON1. "@CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18."   We start our snowman by building the base (The biggest piece for the bottom). @CAPS3 after about @NUM1 minutes the base is almost done, but we notice that we're getting cold. "@CAPS7 we should go inside?" @PERSON1 says. "@CAPS8, I @CAPS7 mom will even make us some hot chocolate." @CAPS9 off we go back inside hoping for some delectably warm hot chocolate. I see @CAPS11 mom @CAPS3 ask, "@CAPS10 we have some hot chocolate please?" "@CAPS11 @CAPS18 look cold, Of course I'll make @CAPS18 some." @CAPS9 @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit downstairs waiting anxiously for our hot chocolate by the heater to get warm.   "@CAPS5's ready!" @CAPS11 mom calls from upstairs. We fly down the hall @CAPS3 rush up the stairs. @CAPS3 to our amazement we find not only hot chocolate but a bag of chips as @CAPS28. "@CAPS14 mom!"I say. "@CAPS14 @CAPS16 @CAPS17!"says @PERSON1. "@CAPS18're welcome boys"says @CAPS11 mom. @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I sit down at the table @CAPS3 start drinking our hot chocolate, while @CAPS11 mom puts some chips on paper towels for us. I start eating the chips by the handfuls whereas @PERSON1 grabs one, just one. I ask him," @CAPS19 did @CAPS18 only grab one @PERSON1?" @CAPS20 of the corner of his eye @CAPS34 looks at me @CAPS3 slowly brings the chip to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. As @CAPS34 did that I fell @CAPS20 of @CAPS11 chair in a fit of hysterical laughter.    @CAPS11 mom hears the thump of me hitting the floor @CAPS3 runs upstairs to find me laughing. "@CAPS1's @CAPS9 funny?" she asks. I say to @PERSON1, "@CAPS22 her." @PERSON1 then complies @CAPS3 grabs another chip @CAPS3 while @CAPS34 looks at her from the corner of his eye, slowly brings @CAPS5 to his mouth @CAPS3 takes a bite. I start busting up laughing again, yet @CAPS11 mom doesn't see the humor. She simply asks," @CAPS23 is that @CAPS9 funny?" @PERSON1 replies," I have no idea but @CAPS34 just about died from laughter. I start to stop laughing @CAPS3 I'm able to stand up again. I then tell @CAPS11 mom," @CAPS5's the way @CAPS34 looks at @CAPS18, @CAPS5 just makes @CAPS18 laugh."   I then @CAPS35 to do the same thing, but with no effect to @PERSON1. "@CAPS19 isn't @CAPS5 working?" I ask. "@CAPS26 I'm awesome like that @CAPS3 @CAPS18're @NUM2 says. "@CAPS6, @CAPS28 I'm gonna keep at @CAPS5 until I get @CAPS5 right." @CAPS9 I @CAPS35 to mimic everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I made happen was I spilled @CAPS11 hot chocolate all over myself, which made him laugh, albeit not the way I wanted to. "@CAPS18 want me to @CAPS22 @CAPS18?" @PERSON1 says. "@CAPS31!!!! Please!" I beg. "@CAPS6, @CAPS33't say I didn't warn @CAPS18." @CAPS34 proceeds then to grab another chip @CAPS3 while looking at me from the corner of his eye, bites the chip. I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS3 without pause. After about @NUM1 minutes I stop laughing.   "I'll get that right!" I say. @PERSON1 says,"@CAPS35 @CAPS5." I grab a chip @CAPS3 look straight at him @CAPS3 bite down, nothing. I @CAPS35 again, this time while looking at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye, nothing yet again. I @CAPS7 to myself, "@CAPS36 I @CAPS33't get @CAPS5 this time I'm giving up." "@CAPS6, here goes." I grab a chip @CAPS3 slowly bring @CAPS5 to @CAPS11 mouth while squinting at him from the corner of @CAPS11 eye. I bite the chip. I notice @CAPS34's laughing. @CAPS34's laughing!!! "I told @CAPS18 I'd get @CAPS5!" " @CAPS31, @CAPS31 @CAPS18 did." @CAPS3 this is one of the many times laughter brought @CAPS11 cousin @PERSON1 @CAPS3 I together."	20	18	40	40				4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
20723	8	" My best friend, @PERSON1 and I have been close ever since we were @NUM1. We met through @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lessons at our local dance studio. We've stayed close throughout the years because we've always done similar activities. We're very different from each other though. I'm more out going, I like to speak my mind and I'm more carefree. @CAPS4's the opposite. @CAPS4's very conservative and @CAPS4 can take things too seriously. But either way, we manage to even each other out. Finals week had just gotten over, and @LOCATION1 and I had been planning a sleepover all week. We just needed time to relax and have some time to ourselves. When I had gotten home from school, I gave her a quick call. ""@CAPS3?"" @CAPS4 answered. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS12 time did @CAPS16 wanna hang out?"" I asked. ""I was thinking @NUM2?"" ""@CAPS6 good!"" I quickly hung up the phone and gathered up my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and my blanket. I put my shoes on and headed back out the door. My dad dropped me off with all of me gear. I had brought my pajamas, my pillow, and an extra blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked, and waited. Only seconds later did @CAPS4 answer it with a big smile across her face. @CAPS4 lead me down to her basement where @CAPS4 had all the junk food set out ready for us to attack. @CAPS4 had gone to the store earlier that day and had bought everything. @CAPS4 had set it all up on her old pool table that nobody used. There were chips, cookies, sodas, candy, chocolate, and pizza. I set my stuff down on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we could eat all the food. We simply weren't big enough. After eating for almost an hour straight, we laid on her basement floor trying to gain composure. We started laughing at silly little things that came up on commercials on her big screen @CAPS7. Eventually, we got to talking about how each of our finals went. ""I did soo good on all of mine! I'm gonna get ALL A's"" @PERSON1 bragged. @CAPS4 has gotten straight A's every year since middle school. ""I think I did pretty @CAPS8 too, not so sure about a @NUM3 though."" I said as I was laying upside down on the floor. ""@CAPS8, we'll just see tomorrow!""  We finally decided to move ourselves over to the couch on the opposite side of the pool table, so we could face the @CAPS7. It was already @NUM4 in the @TIME1 and we were still on a sugar high. We switched back and forth from watching some old scary movie, and the top @NUM5 music videos of the week. That had passed some time and before we knew it, it was @NUM2 in the @TIME1. @PERSON1 and I were laying on opposite ends of each other. Occasionally, one of us would get some chips or candy from the table. We grew tired to the point where we couldn't keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep fast. When I woke-up the next @TIME1, @PERSON1 wasn't laying across from me anymore. @CAPS4 was sitting in the corner chair where I had set my stuff. I looked at the clock, and it was already @NUM4:30 in the afternoon. I looked back and @LOCATION1, @CAPS4 seemed somewhat upset. I shifted around under my blanket so I could face her. ""@CAPS5..."" I grunted, while I was stretching. ""@TIME1."" @CAPS4 said abruptly. @CAPS4 was holding a folded piece of paper in her hand. ""@CAPS12's up?"" I asked, sitting up on the couch. @CAPS4 crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I picked it up from my lap and unfolded it. It was her report card. I scanned down the paper looking at all of her grades. @CAPS4 had received all A's... and one @CAPS13. @CAPS4 had gotten a @CAPS13 in her @CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper to see her hands covering her face. I walked over to her kinda amused by how upset @CAPS4 was.  ""@CAPS16 got a @CAPS13... and @CAPS16're crying?"" I asked. @CAPS4 looked up at me quickly. I looked at her with a stupid face, and @CAPS4 busted out laughing. @CAPS4 felt so stupid for crying over @NUM8 @CAPS13. I stared laughing too. I knew my grades we be far worse. Heck, I'd be glad to get @CAPS13's. @PERSON1 and I are the perfect best friends. We even each other out. I tell her to lighten up, and @CAPS4 tells me to focus more. @CAPS16 can't take little things like that too seriously, it's just not worth the stress. Sometimes @CAPS16 just gotta relax, and maintain your focus. @CAPS16 have to find your perfect balance of work, and play."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

20725	8	" I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness."	21	20		41				4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20726	8	" Laughter, one of life's greatest gifts. Have you ever laughed so hard that you cried? What about laughed so hard you can't breath, or noise no longer escapes from your lips? I am the type of person that can @CAPS6 at something so stupid that when I get done laughing, I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can @CAPS6 so hard that nothing comes out at all! @CAPS1's amazing what laughter can do to a persons heart. The way @CAPS1 makes you feel, the way @CAPS1 makes you act. @CAPS1's so contagious, and @CAPS1 happens all around us everyday. You are never too old for laughter, @CAPS1 happens to the best of us. young or old, @CAPS1 doesn't matter. Laughter has no age limit. One time @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I stayed up until three in the @TIME1. We were so delirious, and kooky, we acted like crazy people. Now we have the type of relationship where we can @CAPS6 at almost anything. Literally almost anything... As we were staying up, we drank lots of soda and had sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We made up songs, we danced around @CAPS2 house, and @CAPS1 felt like we laughed for hours! I laughed until tears were flowing out of @CAPS2 eyes, and i couldn't get a breath out of @CAPS2 heaving lungs. When @CAPS1 gets to the silent laughing, @CAPS1's even more funny because that person can't control @CAPS1, and they look so hilarious because there rocking back and forth, with this silly expression upon their face, not making any noise at all. Have you ever just laughed for what feels like a lifetime? How did you feel after that ""lifetime"" of laughter? @CAPS1 almost feels as something as powerful as the sun just warms over your heart and soul. When I @CAPS6 I feel all the happiness and emotion just flow all throughout @CAPS2 entire body. @CAPS1's one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a greater feeling than the warmth that laughter brings. @CAPS1's so great when you and a @CAPS3, or group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even when your feeling down, maybe need some cheering up. You can always depend on a @CAPS6 to pull you through. No matter what mood I'm in, @CAPS5 I hear someone laughing, @CAPS1 is so hard to not join in. Laughing is so contagious! @CAPS1 effects us in our everyday life's. I bet you that, you cannot go one day without hearing someone @CAPS6, or you not laughing yourself. I probably @CAPS6 about five hundred times a day, @CAPS5 not more. I love hearing people @CAPS6, @CAPS1 brightens @CAPS2 mood and also @CAPS2 day. I would most definitely say laughter is very important and beneficial for a relationship. I mean imagine the world without laughter. Boring, right? @CAPS2 advice, @CAPS6 like you heard the funniest thing in the world. @CAPS6 like there is no tomorrow. Who cares @CAPS5 people thinks its dumb. You'll feel much better after you have that tear-induced, hard to breath, silent but oh-so therapeutic @CAPS6. Laughter really is the shortest distance between people!"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
20727	8	" Laugher Laughter is to express delight, fun, or a object of a joke. Laughter is something we all do, its a large benefit in our life and it happend on a everyday scedual. Without laughter we couldn't express our happy, out going side, we would have no particullar feeling in life except for frowning, which is a proven fact to cose more wrinkles beacuse of how many more muscles it uses.  For me laughter is a all day thing, @CAPS1 show, my friends, family and, horses are my number one reason for my frown to be tured up side down. You @MONTH1 think horses cant smile, or talk but @CAPS2 do have their own ways of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @CAPS2 are all smart, but @CAPS2 can be clutsy or goofy at times. Mostly @CAPS2 all just make you laugh and giggle like your own little brothers or sisters.  There is this one time that I will always have locked away in the back of my mind. It took place on a @DATE1 mid-day at the beach on the @ORGANIZATION1. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses saddled, ready to go. Both us and our horses felt the energy rush when we saw the waves pouning at the shore with the salty smell in our noses.  Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind wistling past our ears like a moving train. The horses heads were equaly pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water, the horses pranced and danced arounds like yearlings again, @CAPS2 would walk tell into the water tell it was drenching us both then soon as the next wave would come rushing up, we'ed swerve around and try to beat the wave to the shore.   After about five hours of adventuring caves, sand dunes and starfish we were all worn out, then decided to call it a day. It was around dinner time, so we eat dinner while watching the sun go down to finsih the perfuct day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before I shut the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on his neck, as I was about to walk out my horse tured his head, then gave my a nudge like he was saying ""thanks for the good time"". Driving home I knew this was a perfuct day because of the laughter, and of all the times I just laughed for the injoyment, also my face did hurt a little from smiling so much."	16	15		31				3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
20728	8	" Starting a story out with two @NUM1 @DATE1 old boys named @ORGANIZATION1 can already be considered a comedy. Those are the names of my identical twin cousins @ORGANIZATION1 I can honestly admit that they are @NUM2 of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the most intelligent human on earth, @ORGANIZATION1 by the way he named his children it's apparent that his sense of humor is a little bit off, but he's a really hard working man. Occasionally my mom does him favors by taking the twins off his hands for a little while because they can be a handful. Weekends are specifically better to have them over because of my hateful step siblings whom hate me, my brother, my sister, @ORGANIZATION1 even my mom. The amount of tension in the house isn't a healthy amount, so a couple of @NUM1 @DATE1 old running around livens it up a little @ORGANIZATION1 makes us all laugh together as a family. It must have been @DATE1 in @DATE2 when @CAPS7 was home @ORGANIZATION1 we were building onto our house when the twins came over. My mom was getting quite furious at their insanely high energy levels, she appeared to be on the verge of ripping out all her hair. My step dad @PERSON1 needed to go to @PERSON2's for nails @ORGANIZATION1 child locks @ORGANIZATION1 I decided to tag along with him. I thought it would have been a great idea to take the twins with us, just to relieve my mom of the loud mouths for a few minutes. We loaded up the car @ORGANIZATION1 I drove down the highway, amused with the twins in the back seat playing with the ponies @ORGANIZATION1 laughing at the people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like twinkle twinkle little star, @ORGANIZATION1 the @ORGANIZATION2's until we arrived in the @PERSON2's parking lot. @ORGANIZATION1 finds it pretty hilarious to run down the isles @ORGANIZATION1 hide behind items on the lower shelves, while @ORGANIZATION1 enjoys pretending he's @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 getting @CAPS7 confused. Eventually the twins were being too obnoxious, resulting in @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 me catching them @ORGANIZATION1 holding them as captives in the seat-belts of the @PERSON2's cart. It was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued along on our adventure in search of the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 found them down isle @NUM4. There was a large man standing in front of our destination @ORGANIZATION1 when i say large I don't mean muscular, or tall... I mean he probably has a few too many @CAPS1 shows he watches daily, @ORGANIZATION1 maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long @ORGANIZATION1 sandy blond, he wore a dark purple @CAPS2 die shirt @ORGANIZATION1 slip on sandals. @ORGANIZATION1 apparently hadn't realized how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude fashion, especially when they can hear you. He said, ""@CAPS3 cow @ORGANIZATION1 look at that lady! She's so huge!"" @ORGANIZATION1 laughed outrageously @ORGANIZATION1 agreed. ""@CAPS4! She's as big as our whole car!"" I panicked a bit @ORGANIZATION1 tried to get them to be quiet, however the twins paid @CAPS5 attention to me, they were much more excited to see the man on the tall ladder next to me giggling @ORGANIZATION1 laughing along with them. They were quiet for a moment then @ORGANIZATION1 gasped @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed, "" @CAPS5 she's as big as a fire truck!"" The man turned around @ORGANIZATION1 glared at me; i apologized at least @NUM5 times @ORGANIZATION1 started to take the boys out of the isle when the man on the ladder hit a button to make the ladder move. I was walking behind the larger man when the ladder made a ridiculously loud beeping sound, like that of a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear @ORGANIZATION1 shouted frantically, ""@CAPS6 run as fast as you can hurry! She's backing up @ORGANIZATION1 she's going to squish you on the floor!"" @CAPS7 laughed, even the man they were making fun of, but i was so embarrassed that i just took them to the car @ORGANIZATION1 waited for @PERSON1. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only big trucks beep when they are backing up, but unsurprisingly, they didn't listen to a word i said. @PERSON1 only took approximately @NUM6 more minutes before he came jogging out the door with the nails, the child locks, @ORGANIZATION1 a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store @ORGANIZATION1 i chuckled quietly until @PERSON1 hopped into the truck, then i started laughing profusely. When I returned home I told my mom what had happened, she laughed for a while @ORGANIZATION1 i laughed even harder @ORGANIZATION1 quite a bit longer than i had before. I went to sleep with a fairly massive headache that night, but i think it was worth laughing all day for."	23	16	44	44				5	5	5	5	5	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	5	5	5	5	4	4

20733	8	" People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes a you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"".  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, ""@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""@CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time"". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh. That's @CAPS2 makes our family relationship stick together, and other familys also.I finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship."	18	18		36				3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20734	8	"    ""Laughter is the best medicine."" The phrase almost everyone has heard before. But it'@CAPS20 true! I've had days when all I could think about was how @CAPS23 life sucked, or at least seemed to. The days when you feel like everything is going wrong, and nothing could make it worse... And that'@CAPS20 when one of @CAPS14 best friends will make me laugh. I'll laugh so hard I'm on the verge of @CAPS19 @CAPS14 pants and @CAPS14 eyes water. I'll laugh so hard no sound comes out, @CAPS14 sides cramp and I fall on the floor. They make me laugh so hard, sometimes I think that even if I was in a coma, they'd say something so funny that I'd sit straight up in the hospital bed and @CAPS21 laugh the huge belly laugh that sometimes escapes me.    There was this particular time when @DATE1, @CAPS1 and I were feeling more giggly than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time was way different than the others. We staggered to @CAPS1'@CAPS20 house flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know how it is when you and your best friends @CAPS9 @CAPS21 @CAPS13 so tickled by each other? Those times when you glance at your friend and @CAPS21 as you've begun to calm down, you see her pinched expression from trying not to laugh, and you lose it all over again. If you've ever had the pleasure of experiencing these silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours at a time. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how hard we were laughing.    Anyway, we stumbled into her house, trying to get serious, since we did have to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were starving after all that laughing, so @CAPS1 told @ORGANIZATION1 and me that we could get some cereal. @CAPS21 regular milk and cereal, right? There'@CAPS20 nothing @CAPS22 special about @CAPS4'n @CAPS5 (besides that it'@CAPS20 freaking delicious). But on that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I'd ever tasted, and I @CAPS6, @CAPS6, @CAPS6, milk, so that had to mean something. ""@CAPS7 this milk is so good! @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8!"" @ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. ""@CAPS9 you kidding me with this? What kind of milk do you buy?!"" I blurted out. For some reason that milk was really extraordinary, and it was seriously blowing @CAPS14 mind. ""@CAPS10, I don'@CAPS17 know. Two percent?""@CAPS1 looked at us incredulously, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. Her expression made us all fall apart in peals of laughter. Now whenever one of us brings it up, we still laugh like it @CAPS21 happened.    @TIME1, it happened. @CAPS1 peed her pants, and not @CAPS21 a little. It wasn'@CAPS17 @CAPS21 the idle threat rushed out, the ""@CAPS12'mgoingtopee!"" squeal. @CAPS13 no. She actually peed herself, and I still @CAPS16'@CAPS17 even remember what I said to make her laugh that hard. All I know is suddenly (scaring me half way to death), she yelled out, ""@CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS8 I @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS18 @CAPS19! THERE'@CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24!!"" I whipped around and saw @CAPS1, red-faced and open-mouthed, supporting herself against the counter. She looked like the freaking @CAPS26 @CAPS27 of @LOCATION1 all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tight, crinkling at the corners, a few stray tears escaping as she tried to hold in shrieks of (apparently) crippling laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, and then I was totally straight out laughing at her; pointing and laughing @CAPS14 shoulder-shake laugh, and it only made her laugh harder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-type run down the hall to the bathroom, where @DATE1 was. @CAPS1, in her wet jeans and with a red, tear streaked face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly bewildered and amused with what @CAPS21 happened. So naturally, @ORGANIZATION1 laughed at the sight of her, in her comically delirious state. Who wouldn'@CAPS17 have?   The fact that we @CAPS16 always laugh at each other and ourselves is why I love @CAPS14 friends . It'@CAPS20 great when you have people that you @CAPS16 laugh about everything and nothing with. @CAPS1 is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and @ORGANIZATION1'@CAPS20 pretty clever when it comes to thinking of them. Personally, I love laughing, especially with (and mostly at) @CAPS14 best friends.    "	23	20		43				4	4	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4

20736	8	"               ""Laughter"" A good relationship is built on trust, right? That's what I've heard my whole life, but as I've grow and really started thinking for myself I came up with my own kind of survival guide, if you will, to good relationships for anyone. Sure trust is important but @CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned laughter is just as important to not only starting a relationship but keeping @CAPS2 full of life. One person in my life helped me really understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding with each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mothers, I am very fortunate. Sure we have hard times just like any family, but we are able tolaugh @CAPS2 off with time and start new. @CAPS5 helped me realize, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 a great bond with my mom is so important to me, we have not always ran so smoothly though. From about age ten to thirteen I was a bit troubled in the sense of not wanting to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay quite.Then seeing my mom as someone who was strong and beautiful, I have to admit I was a bit worried @CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show who I really was to her. Whenever @CAPS5 would joke around with me I would take @CAPS2 all to seriously and whenever we would fight about small things I thought @CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now I was silly to think that, but I'm actually glad we went through that. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like how there would be no rainbow without the rain or how there would be no happy ending if all was well throughout your whole life. Little did I know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One night after dinner my mom had informed me that @CAPS2 was my night to do dishes, unlike usual I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. My mother came in my room upset and frustrated. @CAPS5 said, ""@PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now."" I jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen. @CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, ""@PERSON1? Are you alright, @CAPS2's okay that you forgot. I'm not mad."" @CAPS5 exclaimed. Again not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound that came from me was a sigh of relief when I turned back around and noted her absence. When I was finished with the dishes @CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried reading her face, @CAPS5 looked worried. @CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mom that @CAPS5 so desperately wanted to have with me. @CAPS5 told me about how they would @CAPS3 together over silly things and how they promised each other that when they got into fights they would stop themselves, take a deep breath, then @CAPS3. ""@CAPS3? What? Why would you guys do that?"" I questioned.  @CAPS5 replied, "" @CAPS4 laughter is the best cure for any sad feeling or bad day, as grandma would always say."" @CAPS5 helped me experience that by tickling me and joking around. For the fist time in my life I wasn't nervous and I spoke my mind. As we sat there and chucked ourselves to sleep I knew things would be different from here on out, and they were. We now have made that promise to one other and we are able to have wonderful smiling memories together now. Now at fifteen years old I can honestly say without question my mom will always be my best and truest friend. Our bond, our way of getting over tough times, and the way we can @CAPS3 off all stressful things in life makes me feel as if I can get through anything. I've truly realized the meaning of the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" "	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20737	8	" Laughter. A story about laughter is what you want to hear? Well my life is filled with laughter and smiling. Crazy I know! If it wasn't for laughing I would not have the six pack that I have today. Have you ever stopped to think about when one person can make another person laugh they usually become really close friends maybe even best friends? My boyfriend is my best friend. This one time my boyfriend and I were laughing so hard. My boyfriend is my life. I spend pretty much everyday with him, he is so amazing. Me and him well we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best best friend anyone could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, a lot can happen in one year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even move away from those relationships you just made. Me and @PERSON1 we are always laughing, at each other and at other things as well. We always have fun times with each other. It was a late @DATE1 @TIME1 and he was walking me home like he always did before. There is this field with extremely tall grass and we were walking right next to it. All of a sudden out of no where he acts like he is getting pulled into the grass. So guess what I did, I screamed as loud as I could possibly scream! Then he starts calling my name in a creepy voice telling me to come over to the grass. Out of curiosity of what just happened I start walking over towards the tall grass. When I arrived to the spot where he entered the grass he tells me ""@CAPS1 I lost my shoe and I can't seem to find it anywhere!"" @PERSON1 and I start looking everywhere for his shoe. We couldn't see anything because it was really dark, so we used our hands to search around for his shoe, ""I found it!"" I said. After we found the shoe we realized two hours went by. We were so tired we laid down in the grass to take and break and we both started cracking up with laughter because of how ridiculous it was that we spent two hours on something that was suppose to be a little joke! it was so awesome. When we finally got to our feet our bellies hurt so bad and were very sore. I have never laughed harder than that in my life. Every time I'm with @PERSON1 is the best time ever. We always seem to find a way to make each other laugh. Without best friends or even just friends you would probably find it hard to laugh. With friends you always have someone to laugh at and also laugh with. This is why i cherish my best friend @PERSON1 and all the happy and laughing times we have together, because you'll never know when the last time you'll see that person will be. I try to be as happy as I can and I try to always make people laugh because laughter is the best way of exercise."	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20739	8	" Laughter is a big part in my relationship. I feel so much more connected with a person if we laugh together. Laughing make's you feel great. You could be in a depression stage and either a friend or a family member could walk up to you and pacify you and make you laugh. If I had a relationship that had no laughter in it, I would leave that person as fast as I could. Some people think relationships are only about money and/or looks.People now and days don't last that long in a relationship. Back in the old days people would die together, and even in death they would have there graves right by each other. My boyfriends name is @PERSON1. We have been going out for four years now. He is a very funny, I love his jokes. Sometimes he doesn't even try to make a joke, but he does anyway. When we where first going out, I was throwing a birthday party and me, @PERSON1 and one of his friends went in the woods and hid from everyone else. When the others came to find us we jumped out and scared them. They where mad at us, but when night fall came we where all laughing about it together. My mom and dad don't really laugh together that much. They just go to @ORGANIZATION1 with each other and come home together. My dad loves to crack jokes now and then, but my mom is the kind of person who likes to laugh at the other people that gets hurt. My grandma is so funny. She try's to make people laugh and hurt them selves so she can get a kick out of it. All of my friends are funny. My best friend @LOCATION1 is the funniest girl I have ever known. She likes to dance funny and mock people that she doesn't like. When she works, she'll try to find something to make a joke out of, so she could bring it to me and almost make me pee my pants. @LOCATION1's relationship was very bad. She loves to laugh but her boyfriend hates making jokes. She tried to stick it out but things got worse and worse. The only thing he would do is sit on his bed or his couch and play video games, or watch wrestling. He would make @LOCATION1 clean his room and do the dishes. He has a one year old sister and he makes her watch her,clean her, and feed her while he was up in hie room playing video games. @LOCATION1 got so tired of it , so she packed her stuff and she left. She went to her sisters house. Now she has a funny boyfriend and they always laugh together. There can be a laughing relationship with animals as well as humans.Animals are the one thing that cant talk back or make fun of you. Animals are just like humans, but they cant talk and they have fur. My cat is the king of my house. His name is @CAPS1. He loves to follow me all over my house. I love to sit on the floor and watch him wrestle with all of the other cats.Every time I go into the kitchen he is always there with me, bagging for food. After he eats, he gets an erg of energy and runs all over the house. It makes me laugh. He will stop right in front of me and just stare at me, if I move then he will run away. Cats are cute but not all of them have the power to look into your soul like my cat. @CAPS1 has big eyes and his meow is so sweet and incessant. The funniest thing about him is how fat he is. He is a fat cat, but he is only one years old. So when I see him running all over the place it makes me laugh. My horse is the same way. His name is @CAPS2, and he is four years old. He is a crazy horse, but at the same time he is very funny. He try's to play with my other horses and get hurt because he bites them, so they kick him back. He has a blue eye, so I bought him for my purposes. Some people thinks horses are just a bill, but I think they are my family."	15	15		30				3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
20741	8	" Everyone enjoys laughter. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Many times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh many times throughout the day on account of I am happy. One topic that brings me laughter is my niece. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 is two years old. She is the most adorable little girl in the world. At least in my opinion she is. Since she is so young she does not have a care or worry in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case she is full of joy, and happiness, which causes her laughter. When I am with her all that takes place is laughter, and playing. These are the greatest moments. @CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and when ever you put the shapes into the right slots it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh, and dance uncontrollably. Which in return gets me laughing. It soon ends up being a huge laugh fest. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition added to the family. @PERSON1, my nephew, and @CAPS2 brother. As @PERSON1 gets older, he keeps learning new things, and @CAPS3 loves it. She laughs harder then ever. She thinks it is the funniest thing when he starts laughing. These are the greatest moments. As we can see laughter is happy, and fun. Laughter starts with smiling, and smiling is also rooted from being happy. Many things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew is just one example. What makes you laugh and smile?"	15	20		35				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20742	8	" Why is it that laughter can bring people so close together? Is it because laughing shows trust for one another, or is it simply because you understand each other. There many different kinds of laughter, like cracking a joke, or someone does something very embarrassing. The story that I will be telling is about how such a bad day for hunting turned into the funniest moments ever.   It all started in the @TIME1 when I woke up, and I had forgotten to put my wet clothes that were in the washer machine to the dryer. Now I had to dig through all my clothes up in my room and find camouflage clothes that weren't dirty, or were something that I could wear. By this time anybody would be in a bad mood, and trying rush to get out the door. When my buddy @PERSON1 showed up and was ready to go and I wasn't. I was rushing, and when you rush you are bound to forget something, and I had left my gun at the house. Five miles down the road I noticed that I had forgotten my gun, so we turned around and went back to go get it. Not only now we were late, we were speeding to the cabin for breakfast, @PERSON1 had the eggs so that we could make omelets. As we are racing down, we hit a bump in the road and everything, I mean everything hit the ceiling in the truck and then slammed to the floor. In doing this all the eggs broke in the egg carton, so now we had no eggs, and no eggs meant no breakfast.  Its about thirty minutes till shooting hours, and we are late showing up to the blind so that @PERSON1 and I can meet up with our other friends, @PERSON3 and @PERSON2. Finally we get to the blind right before sunrise and while we are getting all set up, a group of twenty mallards drop in unexpected and took off before we could get a shot off. Now were all thinking great their goes our opportunity to redeem ourselves from a terrible @TIME1. Only to find out that those ducks were the only ducks we saw all day.   At around twelve o'clock we gave up, and went back up to the cabin, but on the way up we got stuck in two inches of water in a truck. I remember thinking to myself, ""@CAPS1 this is not really happening to us right now"". So @PERSON3, @PERSON2, and I got out of the truck to push, and @PERSON1 stayed in the truck to drive. Their were many attempts to push the truck out, and finally on the sixth try we pushed the truck hard enough to get it out of the muddy water. Now the funny part, when we had broke the truck free @PERSON1 laid on the gas causing the truck tires to spin, and spray mud everywhere. When I saw the amount of mud being hurled everywhere I jumped behind @PERSON2 and used him as a shield from the mud. By this point @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 are @CAPS2 in a inch thick layer of mud from head to toe. You couldn't help but laugh, it was the funniest thing ever. @PERSON1 had watched it all through his rear view mirror and as soon as he was safe from getting the truck stuck again, he fell out of the truck because he was laughing so hard. Even @PERSON3, and @PERSON2 were laughing a bit too.  So when its a day when nothing goes your way or having bad luck, you never know what the day has planned for, in this case its one of the most memorable things I remember that happened that duck season."	20	20		40				4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20743	8	" ""@CAPS1 figure something out to do! I am really freaking bored!"" @CAPS2 explained as all of us relaxed next too his dark blue @CAPS3 which was gracefully parked right out side of my house. The @ORGANIZATION1 was young and as young boys we needed something to do. Gears started to turn in my head! As i thought of a bullet proof plan that would be very funny.  ""@CAPS4 I've got it!"" I yelped. ""@CAPS1 here it, I'm really down for anything right @CAPS21,"" @CAPS6 quickly replied. ""@CAPS7 since @CAPS2 has car he can drive into town and buy some cheap saran rap then @CAPS15 back to the four way intersection right out side of my neighborhood and tie the rap around two of the trees on opposite sides of the street so cars will speed through it!"" I quick explained as i ran out of breath. Bursts of loud laughter came from all directions were my friends were standing as I came to realization that this idea was golden. ""I will drive and go get it, but does anyone got some money too pitch in!"" @CAPS2 pounced as @LOCATION2, @CAPS6 and I, handed single bills to him.  "" that's plenty! give me a few minutes then we can meet at the intersection right out side of @CAPS10's neighborhood."" @CAPS2 said as he brushed everyone off his car and begin to dip out of my neighborhood. ""@CAPS12 text me when you're about to get back!"" I screamed to @CAPS2 as sound of his poorly maintained engine bellowed in the @TIME1 sky. Minutes flew by and the rest of us just sat down on the curb, talked, and waited for @CAPS2. Ring ting my custom ring tone for incoming texts sounded. My eyes quickly scanned the phone's contents and concluded that @CAPS2 was ready with the saran rap at the four way intersection.  ""@CAPS15 on @CAPS1 @CAPS4 go! @CAPS2 is ready and so @CAPS1 do this thing"" I muttered as i grabbed my jacket and headed for the exit of my neighborhood. @CAPS6 trailed, as @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 brought up the back. i yelled once again to enhance the passe. @CAPS2's car lights lit up the @ORGANIZATION1 air as he made a blinking signal to express where he was to us. All four of us quickly jogged over to the drive way of a house that was for sale right near the exit of my neighborhood to where @CAPS2 was parked. ""@CAPS17 you @CAPS4 long enough,"" @CAPS2 explained. ""well we are all here! so @CAPS1 go to the intersection and set this up!"" @PERSON1 explained as the started too lead toward the intersection which was about fifty yards away. As we reached the intersection there were no cars! We all @CAPS17 to this opportunity and @NUM1 and @PERSON1 look out for cars!"" i yelled as @CAPS2 and i began the process. Quickly i opened the saran rap and ran crossed the road, uncoiling the rap as i went. Soon as @CAPS2 and I were both on opposite sides of the street we both started to firmly rap the saran around trees we have already pick out. Once i pulled and inspected it finding that it was prefect i sprinted to a short fence that was a boarder for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. i was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. ""haha this is prefect! i am made sure everything feels right!"" I explained as we all gazed upon delicately hung rap than ran from both sides of the two way street. ""@CAPS21 we must wait,"" @PERSON2 said as anticipation fell into place. Four heads bobbed up and down as we checked to see if cars were driving down the road. Since it was about @NUM2 pm most of the good folk of @LOCATION1 were sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car came out of @CAPS21 were, speeding and only @NUM3 yards from the great prank. ""@CAPS22,"" i yelled as the car continued driving closer and closer. Boom! The car speed through the saran rap, then came to a screeching stop. Laughter burst out as the inspected target was completely in disarray. But the anger male driver hearing our laughing decided too leave his car and chase us! ""@CAPS23 up,"" I screamed! We all @CAPS23 right as the man reached the fence where we were hiding. Although it was too late for @CAPS6! The anger man caught him as the rest of us all high tailed it for my house. As soon as we reached my house we all began too ask our self's what happened too @CAPS6! Suddenly out of @CAPS21 where @CAPS6 came running, as he @CAPS22 reached us we started too burst into laughter once again! The whole left side of @CAPS6 was dripping with soda! @CAPS6 would never tell us what happened that @ORGANIZATION1 although we could have guessed! As the @CAPS25 and long @ORGANIZATION1 rapped up we all called quits and hit the sack at my house. But laughter wasn't in short supply that @ORGANIZATION1 as we all fell asleep!"	22	20		42				5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

20746	8	" In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter."	17	16		33				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	3						
20747	8	" These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. I believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. One of the people I enjoy being around most is my best friend @PERSON1. No matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. Laughter can turn a bad day completely around. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my, ""friends"", tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I had figured out that this person whom I once trusted was trying to spite me I became overwhelmed with my emotions. At one point I actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. Thankfully I used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. Half of the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. So there I stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @PERSON1 had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. She talked to me until I calmed down and my tears stopped. She made me feel much better. Her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my,""friend"", who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky in that I have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. Every body has to have a somebody."	18	20		38				3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20748	8	"Friends are'nt always what we want them to be they arent always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh a friendship can become. I mean what is a friendship if there isnt those moments where you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breath and you feel like you have just done one hundred sit-ups. Ofcourse you @MONTH1 meet a friend like this and it @MONTH1 happen when you least expect it. I didnt expect a new friendship but in a new town and with new people i met the friend i now call bestfriend.  It was the year of @NUM1 and i was new to @ORGANIZATION1. In homeroom everyone stared at me like i was some kind of criminal and everyone talked behind my back when i would pass by their desks, well atleast thats how i felt. My homeroom teacher @PERSON2 @CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, @CAPS2 class with @PERSON1. What? @CAPS2, what is that. I really had no idea what a @CAPS2 was until i walked into that class. I turned the rusty knob of the door to the gym where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and well there I found out what a @CAPS2 was. It was a one wheeled bike. Wow! I laughed thinking how did i not know that.  I looked around and saw that i was the only sixth grader around. I took a seat and looked everywhere trying to figure out if i was really the only sixth grader there, when in walked a girl that looked about my age. She took a seat and i wondered if she was nice so i could go talk to her, but i was to emberrassed to. @PERSON1 asked everyone to get in groups of two and i asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to useb the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride with no help. Class was over and i tolde her my name was @PERSON3 and she told me her name was @CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because i now actually had a ""friend"" well atleast someone i talked to. I went into the class and she was absent so I was a loner that period. I had to be partners with this other girl named savannah witch was a total girly girl. She didnt want to ride the @CAPS2, all she wanted to was talk. I was sick and tired of her by the end of the day and I had'nt practiced my unicycleing.  I was really hoping @CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she showed up. This time we had to get with our partner and make a routine to a song that we wanted so we were pretty stoked. We started practicing and trying to come up with something when suddenly we both fall. We stared at eachother and just started laughing and laughing i couldnt breath and she almost peed. It was one of the best times i had experianced that year, and i felt like me and her could become the best of friends.  We are now really close friends and just that one moment of laughter together brought us close at heart. We love to laugh we believe that the more you laugh the younger you look and well i think its true. everyone has their own story about how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe that in every friendship what braught it together was a smile or laughter. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends nose. Its a great time and you never forget it, its something that is so simple but so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel around that person. It braught my friendship with a person i had barley met into a friendship that is now insepreable and amazing. "	19	17		36				4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	3						
20751	8	"  It was a normal bright and warm @DATE1 day, going into my fifth grade year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors that were around our age. One of those neighbors happened to be a boy. We could not find anything to do. It was too hot out to just go walk around in the sun, so we decided that it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @CAPS1 had made. He made it out of an old swing set seat and I thought my neighbor would really enjoy it.  We all headed into our garage to get it. My sister offered to get it down for me since she was taller and it was hanging up pretty high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so I would be the one to get it. As I was in total concentration, stretching and reaching to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration got weaker as I begun to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I had found out what happened. My sister pulled down my pants.. in front of our boy neighbor. I picked my pants up off the ground, looked straight at my sister, and started beating her with my flimsy loose fists. I ran straight to my room, crying all the way there.   My sister came in a few moments later trying to bribe me out from under the covers with the last two fruit role ups. She sat on my bed waiting for a half an hour, I didn't budge. She did not say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night I finally came out. My sister kept on apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was upset with her, that's all that mattered. The whole next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignoring mood. My @CAPS1 came up to me and told me that she was terribly sorry and upset too because I was not talking to her. I thought in my head, "" how could she be upset.."" but I realized I had not treated her right, even though I wasn't happy with her.   After hearing what my @CAPS1 had said, I decided that it wasn't worth it. I went and talked to my sister for the first time in days. She told me that she didn't mean to hurt my feelings, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while I concluded that I got so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke around like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone besides family. I was scared that it would have frightened our neighbor friend away, but he was back to play in a few days so I had nothing to be mad about.   Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was pretty funny. We had a good laugh about it and were no longer enemies. I learned that dwelling over the past gets you nowhere and you have to learn to laugh things off. Ever since then, every time it is brought up, we laugh so hard tears role down our face. I would not have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I do now. It is another memory that my sister and I share and can reminisce about. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to some one."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20754	8	"Making someone laugh is the best feeling to their soul, and it is one step closer to internal happiness. People might say that when feeling something good inside the body its when they know that they have done something right. I agree with this because it has happen to me; I was feeling down about something that I cant even remember but, when I felt the need to help someone do something I knew inside of me that I did something very special at that moment. It's amazing how you make someone laugh, and it doesn't matter where you are, you also feel happy. The one person in my life that has a great sense of humor is my mother. She is always in need of something funny.People enjoy laughing so much that it is if they were to take some sort of energy drink to make them not want to stop laughing. I hear people say that laughter is very healthy for a human soul, and it will also make the soul and body last longer. Laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say much. It could be a great way to start a conversation with a person. Positive thinking leads to making good choices especially if happiness leads you on in life. By making someone laugh it makes the awkwardness go away. It is better to laugh then to be sad.Everyone has their addiction to something in which they need to depend on. My mom's addiction is laughing. She laughs at work and she especially laughs at the house whenever I'm around. Although, sometimes she feels down whenever something goes wrong. I hate seeing her like this, because it then makes me feel down. When she is feeling sad it is if there is nothing in the world that would make her cheer up. If one person is feeling depress, that feeling passes on to the next person closest to them. Eventually I get tiered of seeing my mom like this and in this situation I cant help it but to get up and start doing some ridiculous stuff to cheer her up. Some things that pop into my mind is that I can start dancing funny or tell a little lie that might of happen at school that I think will cheer her up. When there is an opportunity to make someone laugh I enjoy to put a smile on their face.My mom means the world to me just as I mean the world to her. We try to help each other in any way as possible. This one day she came home from work and my dad was sitting in the table reading the newspaper and my mom walks in, and notices that my dad hasn't made food yet she started to flip out on him. She thought that it was stupid of him to not make dinner for us. She was pretty angry at him for a period of time, so she started to make us dinner but she was doing it all wrong. She was mixing the spices in the wrong pan, I was going to let her know that she was doing it all wrong, but my dad was holding me back so that I wouldn't get her more angry. She finally finish cooking and served us our plates but we didn't wanted to eat it because she made the food out of anger and made it smell funky. My dad forced us to eat it because he thought that by eating the food it would make her happy, but he was wrong it only made her feel worse because my youngest brother didn't like it. I felt bad so I had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood to not be mad at my dad anymore. I turn on the @CAPS1 and changed the @CAPS2 to the music @CAPS2 and started to dance as if I were to have ants in my pants. Her lungs were about to burst because she was laughing so hard, and eventually she was in a good mood for the rest of the day.Everywhere I go I see people smiling and laughing about something and it only makes me wonder about the funny things that are being said. I think that it is a good thing for someone to feel good about themselves because it brings a positive feeling in the room. I enjoy to see people be happy because it always makes me feel happy. What better way to be happy when smiling is one step closer to laughing. My mom and I like to take walks just so that we wouldn't feel apart and stay closer to each other, we see different people each time we go walking and we always get a smile from them. That is the best feeling in the world, to feel joy is to be free from all your problems."	16	15		31				4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20755	8	" ""Laughter is the key to the soul."" @CAPS1 you are having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, laughing can always make it better. I was sitting in @CAPS2 class one day, and was bored out of my mind. Then, a shy, quiet kid, all of a sudden started laughing! @CAPS3 couldn't stop! It was like @CAPS3 was on ""laughing gas."" @CAPS3 laughed so hard @CAPS3 couldn't breathe. Now this made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laugh. Soon enough the entire class was laughing! So even though some of the people in @CAPS2 class might have been bored, or had a bad day, the laughter was spread throughout the room, making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire, and it makes everyone happier. And when you are happier, you are healthier. So with that, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter in it, in order to work. When you ask someone what they like about there boyfriend or girlfriend, if it is a @CAPS2 relationship, they will almost always say, ""@CAPS3/she makes me laugh."" @CAPS5 when you don't have laughter in a relationship, you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh the more you can live a better life and enjoy life more. Have you laughed today?"	15	15		30				3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20756	8	" Their are many joys in life, some are more relevant then the others, and some are so obvious you'd be stupid no to notice them. Have you ever just sat on your porch or stared out the window just to watch the sun rise, as you sat there pondering your life and its unusual qualities, you think of all the great memories, all the laughs you have shared, all the sorrows, all the pain ,and all the love and hate. Its not surprising that almost everyone has done just that and they wonder if they could change things, how would they do that, or would they leave it the way it started out, filling their life is complete and they are complete as well, not having any regrets.  For all the tears I have cried and all the pain I've been through there has always been a laugh to top the sadness. some time I to sit and pander my life, although i have not lived long and my real experiences are yet to come, I have been through a great deal in my short experiences, but it does not trouble me, for i have taken in what has happened during my time period and I have learned a great deal form it. I've learned that no matter how hard you try you can never fully plain your life theirs always going to be something or someone unexpected, all you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Its not hard to be happy, just keep an open mind and a light heart, and soon you will find yourself laughing with the rest of the world and enjoying your short time on this amazing planet we call @LOCATION1, so listen to your mother and father or even the person you look up to most in life.  There are many things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals, but the most important thing i can think of isn't just one thing its a collection of things, such as love, laughter, new beginnings and old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is take it) , the relentlessness of the universe, and the idea that there @MONTH1 be other planets out there that sustain life, maybe even intelligent life. Its easy to find things to live for and even easier to find things to die for, hopefully you look for things to live for. I remember when it was hard and I thought I would never ever be happy and I felt like I wasn't right for this world and its many confusing aspects. I was at the end of my path or so I was making it out to be, but then something happened as I sat on the side of an old road. I looked up at the stars and thought what would i miss out on if I ended my path now, what would I dare to name my child or children for that matter if I even have the chance to produce any.Who would I marry if i marry, will our love last or fade like morning due. so I finally decided that there was to much i would not experience if I ended it this soon. after that fateful evening I went about my life slowly molding into a better person who wanted a bright future with a romantically new but burning love story to tell to my child or children, and with devotion, trust,and respect would hopefully last. but that's not all I would want my adventure to consist of. I would want to find peace of mind in a place where silence is a scarcity, I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals not pushing them aside or abusing their natural right to be on this @LOCATION1 along side us, I want to solve the pollution problem that we humans have more then helped produce. i suppose in my small way i will because in just one person and a every small thing on this very big home of ours, but as small as I am what i do or say will make an impact. so if I want something to look back and laugh on i had bettered to what i consider my part and making this planet a shared and healthy planet."	18	16		34				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
20757	8	"A true story about how two close friends became friends over the joy of laughter. One year their is a boy named @PERSON1 who wanted to so something fun this @DATE1 ins ted of just staying in his room and playing video games all day. So he heard of a play called""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" from a friend and found out if he could join and help out with the play, but he ended up getting a part of the play and helped back stage when ever he could. @PERSON1 found that he enjoyed the doing the play very much and made a lot of friends. At the some time when @PERSON1 was having fun their was a girl named @ORGANIZATION1 who didn't talk much to @PERSON1 at all, but she liked him and she didn't tell a whole lot of people. @ORGANIZATION1 also tried to make as many friends as she could when doing the plays and spent as much time with her friends as she could. As the play stared to end @PERSON1 stared to hang out with @PERSON2 who is @ORGANIZATION1 older brother and stared to pay a little more attention to her and found out from her brother that she liked @PERSON1, but @PERSON1 already knew that she did like him from the way she acted around @PERSON1. @PERSON1 joined another play called""@CAPS2 in @LOCATION1"" after doing""@CAPS1 In @LOCATION1"" because of how much fun he had in doing the first play. @PERSON1 found he already knew most of the people form doing the first play. So he stared talking to the rest of the people that was their that @PERSON1 didn't knew already. This is when @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 stared talking to each other and both of them found that they enjoyed each others laughter they became vary close friends. they became such close friends vary fast because of how @PERSON1 like to make friends vary easy and @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't have vary many friends or close friends or it could have been the fact that @ORGANIZATION1 liked him so much. @ORGANIZATION1 didn't have vary many friends because the kids at school would make fun of her for being so smart and then she go home schooled and lost some of her only friends that she had. @PERSON1 soon found out in their friendship @ORGANIZATION1 was scared of of @PERSON1 not wanting to be her friend because of all the friends she had already lost. By the time that the play was starting to come to an end @PERSON1 had already noticed that @ORGANIZATION1 had liked @PERSON1 before they were friends and he asked her if she did like him she said no at first, but then she felt bad for lining to him and told him the truth about how she did like him and how she thought that is would be best if they just stay as friends. Both of them knew that they could only be friends because of their age difference. @PERSON1 was @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1 was @NUM2. So they both knew that it would have never have worked out because of their age. So they both agreed that is would be best if they just stay as friends. As the play was ending the used every minute of it to grow their friendship. By the end of the play they both have became close friends and enjoyed the the good times that they had together and also enjoyed the laughter of one another.  Even after the play both of them still talked when ever they had the time to talk to each other, but they didn't get to see each much of each other. When they had the time to talk they talked about the good times that they had with one another and how much fun they had. They also talked about the great and fun that they had in doing the plays. Both of them agreed that they would do the plays again next @DATE1 and looked forward to seeing each other next @DATE1 and how many great thing that they will have to talk about. End the end I think that @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 are going the be friends for a long time. maybe when they get older they could be more then friends and have their friendship go to the next level......... only time will tell."	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20758	8	" I never thought that laughing can help you start a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @CAPS4 can. Just by laughing with someone can get you to meet a new person. One of the things I do first @CAPS6 someone is trying to be funny is laugh. Once you know @CAPS2 the other person is talking about, you forget that you are just getting to know that person. This happened to me once. @CAPS4 happened in @LOCATION1, where my family and I usually go every year in @DATE1. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know, @LOCATION1 is a hot place and the sun is usually out every day. I spend the days we stay over there going out to walk with my sister and cousins or going to the beach with all my family. I remember @CAPS4 was a day that my cousins, sister and I went to a small store that's right down the street from where we stay at. We wanted to buy candy and other stuff to bring with us @CAPS6 we returned to our home. I didn't expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @CAPS6 I saw them, the only thing they were doing was laughing about something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer, I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help overhearing so I started to laugh. One of his friends saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was laughing at him and of course I said no. I told him I had accidentally overheard his conversation so then he started to laugh. ""That was funny wasn't @CAPS4"" he told me laughing. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 was. I didn't know you made jokes like that"" I replied.  He kept on talking to me and then he said, ""I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I don't say @CAPS4 to hurt anyone.""  I thought @CAPS4 was nice for him to clear that out but I already knew people in @LOCATION1 talk like that. We kept on talking @CAPS6 I started to laugh again. ""@CAPS2 did I say now?"" he asked. ""@CAPS3. I was just remembering @CAPS2 you said in the beginning. That was really funny"" I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget of @CAPS2 he said and I don't think I will ever forget. I think @CAPS4 was probably because the way we met was really surprising to me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, by laughing first. I guess I thought @CAPS4 was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we are interested in their subject and we understand them. That's at least @CAPS2 I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacations. I told him that every year I go and I always enjoy them. My family and I have a great time spending time with my grandparent and cousins from @LOCATION1. I told him I sometimes say I would rather live in @LOCATION1 than where I live know because @CAPS4's so much calmer there. He agreed with me on one part of @CAPS2 I had told him because he knows @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like to live in @LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how I's like to live in any other place. After he told me that, he stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation wasn't like in the beginning. In the beginning, we wouldn't stop laughing and we had interesting stuff to say. Then, @CAPS4 got calmer and a little unusual. I didn't want to just stop our conversation there so I asked him where was he going to go because @CAPS6 I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins. Now we started laughing again. This time @CAPS4 was because we just had noticed that the people we were with had left us. ""@CAPS6 did they leave?"" he asked me. ""I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't been talking for a long time,"" I told him. We walked together to go and look for them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were still looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We just got together with them and acted as if @CAPS3 had happened. @CAPS4 was strange for me because whenever I looked at him, I would remember our conversation. The first thing that would come to my mind was that we started our conversation by laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually liked making a new friend this way. Now, whenever I go to @LOCATION1, I know I have a new friend over there and if I decide to, I can make other friends by simply laughing with them in their conversations."	23	18	40	40				5	5	5	4	5	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20759	8	" As I waited in the car, anxious to meet my best friend and man I'm in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mother or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I'd talked to him countless times on the phone, many many text messages, and countless emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than I knew most people, yet my anxiety seemed to be making me lose my sanity.  As our black rental sedan pulled up to where he was waiting outside of where his family lived, I got more nervous. @CAPS6 if he wasn't actually the way I thought he was? @CAPS6 if he didn't like me? @CAPS6 if I didn't like him? As soon as he stepped into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and my anxiety all melted away. I smiled back. ""@CAPS1, @PERSON1,"" he said. ""@CAPS1 @PERSON2,"" I said, butterflies in my stomach. I was smiling broadly still, he reached out and cautiously took my hand.  ""@CAPS3 was the drive?"" he asked, lightly squeezing my hand. ""@CAPS4, and nerve wracking,"" I replied, nervous laughter bubbling up again. ""@CAPS5 your here now, and I'm very happy @CAPS7 are,"" he said, smiling. And for the rest of the car ride to the restaurant our conversation flowed so smoothly I thought I was dreaming. Here him and I were two guys in love with one another, a new thing for both of us, and we were happy as can be. The whole car ride we held hands ad talked, I felt like I'd known him my whole life. Not just the year and a half I'd known him.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 all too fast and all of us got out of the car, I was famished and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for a half-hour before we sat down. Once at the dinner table my mother, who was very happy I found someone I loved so much and knew of our love, started regaling us with tales of my childhood. It was one of the most embarassing moments of my life. I was bright red for almost the entire time she told these stories. Some of which I remembered, others I did not. @PERSON2 laughed and joked wth me about all of them. Which made my nervous laughter come out as actual laughter. It also helped that he was holding my hand under the table.  After we ate dinner and dessert we went to the nearby mall for some shopping and to just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some clothes together and finally ended up in a book store. My favorite book store, @ORGANIZATION3's. Back in my favorite section, young adult fiction, I noticed @PERSON2 staring at me. ""@CAPS6?"" I asked stupidly. He smiled deviously.  ""@CAPS7 just look very... In your element,"" he smirked.  ""@CAPS8?"" I said, in mock confusion. He just smiled and took my hand in his again. ""@CAPS9 problem,"" he said, squeezing my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only people in this area of the store. ""@CAPS10 if I'm a little forward?"" he asked. I shook my head @CAPS9. He leaned in and kissed me very gently on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started to giggle after our lips parted. He quirked an eyebrow, I knew @CAPS6 he was thinking just by the look on his face.  ""That felt fantastic,"" I said, putting my fingers on my lips. I had a silly grin on my face.  ""@CAPS11,"" he simply said, kissing me again. ""I love your laugh, love,"" he told me, I was on cloud nine, I was truly in love with somebody and I felt great! I'd never been this happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to @ORGANIZATION2. But this was definitely better, because it could last much longer. Which it has, since we've been together ever since. Both our gazes fixed our future together. Now whenever I remember that I was start to giggle happily to myself. Yes I get a stare every once in a while, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and I. Making us the closest we've ever been."	23	24		47				4	4	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5	5						
20760	8	" Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS12 we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS12 talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I most have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS12 showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits o laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS12 begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS12 stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON1 was @CAPS10 in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. i was even closer to @CAPS1 then in the first term. So, one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, ""@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"" @CAPS10 even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS12 a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION2, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @CAPS12 said, ""@CAPS11 you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me."" @CAPS12 about five minutes afterwords, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12 with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS10 a science @CAPS13, so we were unable to do to many experiments. So @CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS14, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using the matches, because his nickname for me was @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS11 this happened, i was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS12 I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did so. So @CAPS11 I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so i got after him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS18 class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day, because she lvoed the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS11 he was done giving notes @CAPS12 giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embaressed, so he said to come after class @CAPS12 ask personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste classtime for silly @CAPS12 personal question about him. I thought the entire time, ""@CAPS20 doesn't he just say yes or no?"" @CAPS21 were fun times that I will never forget @CAPS12 tell the day I die. No class, or science class will ever replace fourth period physical science. Nor any teacher replace @LOCATION1, he is @CAPS12 always will be my favorite teacher. I will forever remember the days of every phsycial science class, because of that one simple teacher."	15	15	30	30				3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3
20761	8	" Sometimes I wonder why people laugh. People laugh when something is funny or when things @CAPS3 awkward and they aren't sure what else to do. Often people laugh when they @CAPS3 embarrassed or offended. I, actually, find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh uncontrollably at yourself. Every year, since i moved here six and @DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I have gone ""cheese ball caroling"" with our grandparents around @CAPS1 time. Even after my grandpa died in @DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the twenty-first of @DATE2, we go secret @LOCATION1 shopping one at a time with one of our grandparents while we make the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us have gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them while we practice our carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start the caroling. First thing on the list is the people who's houses we @CAPS3 going to go to that night. Second next to each families name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third is what song we @CAPS3 going to sing to them. Usually, there is about twenty- five to thirty people on the list. All of which @CAPS3 family members and really close friends or people from their work. We always have a really good time with it too. No fighting or bickering or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually, it's been about a year since we have all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went caroling with out my older sister. She went off to college the @DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grand kid there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day went on I could feel it taking it's tole. With her being gone and my grandpa no longer being around made the pressure build uncontrollably. I started to relax a little when we got started and just tried to have fun. My grandma yelled to me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think anything of it. Later she told us we had to come up with a special song for the family. And that's when it hit me. The name looked and sounded familiar because I used to go to school with a boy with the same last name. That's when I asked her to verify if it was the same family. Sure enough, it was. I had had a crush on this boy since I could remember. We lost contact after I had found out he liked my cousin though. I knew it was going to be extremely awkward to have to sing in front of him, not to mention embarrassing. I remember thinking ""@CAPS2 great, this is just what I needed. This is going to be awesome."" We did our rounds and everything went very smoothly. We were having tons of fun, making jokes and laughing at absolutely everything. Then it came time to go to ""his"" house. We all choked up. The girls had heard many things about how cute and dream like this boy was so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling ourselves he wont be home, and even if he was it would be fine and we would be fine. I think that was the longest walk to a house with that short of a walk way ever. My grandma rang the door bell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles gawking at him. He gave us a weird look and said "" @CAPS3 you going to sing or just stand there?"" with an evil little smile. I did attempt to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the youngest cousin starts singing happy birthday. That was not the song we had planned for this house, and it was not his birthday. In the middle of the second ""happy birthday to you"" we all start cracking up laughing, and I don't mean giggling or a small laugh. We @CAPS3 all laughing hysterically to the point where we could not breath, and he shut the door.  I know if we would have just stood there it would have made that memory a lot more dreadful, but because we all were laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It's a memory i'm sure we will never forget. I have done something like that on multiple occasions but that was defiantly number one on my list of ""what were you thinking"" moments. I wouldn't change anything about it."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20762	8	" Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember back in the @NUM1 grade, i was the new student and i sure can tell you that i didn't know where anything really was, it was a new school: new bus, new everything. Being the new student is something no one wants to be, you get made fun of alot and sometimes you just dont fit in. Well thats my story, i never fit in.  One day i was walking up the stairs to my class, and it was a bright sunny day, i dont believe there really was any clouds that day. Anyways, as i was walking up the stairs i tripped and fell backwards and my skirt i was wearing flipped up over my head, and of course in that era of time you had to have character underpants. Well i remember everyone pointing and laughing at me A. because i had just fell down, and @CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underpants. Therefore, i went the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, i laughed right along with them. I honestly thought it was pretty funny, falling down and your underpants show? who doesn't think that's funny? After the fact this girl named @CAPS2 came up to me and told me im not the only one who wears character underpants.We both laughed as hard as we could that whole day, just remembering the fact that me of all people, I fell down the stairs! Next, being the new kid that could actually be taking embarssing, but for me I have done it a million times, so it really didn't bug me as much as people thought it would. @CAPS2 and I, became such great friends, we laughed all the time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in the ice cold water, or back to the time where i fell down the stairs. Up to this day we still talk about that, its just something you really don't get over. Not to mentioned it was pretty funny when my charcter underpants showed.  In conclusion, i think when the quote says ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" really is true, you have to have a good laugh before you can go on with your day, its just a known fact. If you dont laugh throughout your day then something is really wrong with you. Just because your getting older doesn't mean you have to throw away your laugh. Laughing is the part of the day where you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what is your funny story?"	15	17		32				3	3	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3

She made me laugh with everything she said. She was my better half would sum it all up. I still remember when I first seen her in @CAPS1. The nickname of the town was @CAPS1 @CAPS4 hell because of where it was located, in the middle of nowhere. We met when I was on vacation at @CAPS1. My parents had just retired a few months before and were looking for a cozy retirement home away from the big city's and more closer @CAPS4 the good eastern @LOCATION2 mountains that seem @CAPS4 always have snowy tops and beautiful landscapes. We ended up staying there for a week or so in this little trailer that we took with us. That thing was hell on earth, every time we stopped I would have @CAPS4 set everything up even if we weren't going @CAPS4 use it. It was a two hour process and after the hundredth time you can see how I would get bored. looking for a great house @CAPS4 stay in that town was not hard @CAPS4 come by. They were all amazing homemade houses. Never was a contractor paid @CAPS4 build these houses because the men of the town made them by hand. They were incredible two story oak made houses that look like they could take a tornado coming out with only scratches. We ended up finding this one house that was so amazing that I wanted @CAPS4 live there right off the bat, surprisingly my parents wanted it @CAPS4. But the sad thing is is that we had @CAPS4 sell our house first or we wouldn't be able @CAPS4 afford it, so we put that house on the ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"" and headed back @CAPS4 the trailer.  We had another @NUM1 days or so there and I was officially bored out of my mind. I needed something @CAPS4 do besides stock the fire and make sure the hot dogs did not burn. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town ( the trailer park was located about half a mile out of town). I arrived in town @CAPS4 be very disappointing. It was just as boring riding a bike around town and stopping inside the shop @CAPS4 make small talk just as sitting by the fire in @NUM2 degree weather. In my mind it was just another boring vacation but little did I know it was about @CAPS4 get a lot more fun. I woke up the next day and took my shower and got ready for the day. It seemed like another boring day in hell from what I could tell. @CAPS4 me fun was doing stuff I normally would not do. But back then @CAPS1 and places like that just did not cut it because all I did that @DATE1 was go @CAPS4 places like this and do nothing so it was expected of me @CAPS4 be bored. I rode my bike around a corner and I saw a bunch of guys and girls that looked like they just came from fishing or tubing or something fun, so I rode over @CAPS4 see what was going on. I started talking @CAPS4 a guy named @CAPS8. He told me they just got back from a youth group get together on the snake were they went tubing and cliff jumping. I was in aw. That seemed crazy @CAPS4 me. Cliff jumping? Tubing? It seemed way @CAPS4 crazy for a youth group. But I guess that's just how they do things in @CAPS1. They just don't go have a picnic they go do crazy stuff that I personally have not done any of the things they were talking about because for one i not crazy and for two I have never had the chance. We kept talking and before they all left they invited me @CAPS4 go on there nature hike up on top of this mountain. I was more than happy @CAPS4 oblige seeing as I love hiking.  I woke up in the @TIME1 feeling all hipped up and ready @CAPS4 rock. I had my permission slip signed and I was ready for a good ole hike. I jumped on my dads bike and rode into town at five in the @TIME1 and arrived at the youth administrators house just in time for a protein shake for breakfast ( he offered it @CAPS4 me I did not ask). We drove @CAPS4 the mountain and at the base there were around @NUM3 @CAPS4 @NUM4 people all in hiking gear. It surprised me because I was not expecting so many people. That's when I met @LOCATION1. She was gorgeous so I was attracted @CAPS4 her immediately. We began the climb and I began @CAPS4 talk @CAPS4 her. We were like two pees in a pod. I couldn't get enough of her and her of me. Her laugh made me extremely happy. She was my other half. All I can remember is her amazing laugh."	19	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20764	8	"                        `   THE @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 story is about how I fell in dog @CAPS1 and stepped in it, I fell off of a slippery trampoline.about four or five years ago I went too a friends house to stay the @TIME1. That day was a hot day so my friend and I devised a plan to have fun and stay cool, so my friend and I went to the garage and found the sprinkler, so we decided to put the sprinkler under the trampoline and when u do that it makes the trampoline wet and slippery. My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline and he was starting too jump higher then me and I started losing bounce and he came back down the same time as me, but he had more bounce, which made me bounce a lot higher then I normally could also he weighed more then me. So i came back down and I landed on my back and the angle I was at on the trampoline shot me off. As I was bounced off the trampoline I thought I was gonna get hurt and I had rather gotten a few scratches then landing on a dogs manure, but that's just what happen I landed on a pile of dog manure and it really stunk my shirt up so bad, but after i took my shirt off i started jumping again and i jumped for that whole day about but i don't regret it it because after that everyone had a good laugh including me. so @CAPS3 story was a part of laughter and how laughter is a great way to have fun and even when it @MONTH1 have been a bad thing that happen to you, maybe in the end it was funny even though at the time it was not."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20765	8	" @CAPS9 you ever been scared so much that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party. It was called our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" night, we call it ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" because, us @CAPS5 kids, we consider ourselves as @CAPS1. Our night involves @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be ""@CAPS6"".  To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. Everyone reached at my house around @NUM4 pm. We started out by playing videos games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed. Once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the ""@CAPS7 or @CAPS8"" games. I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version didn't you? Well, fortunately we are the @CAPS5 kids. Just your normal ""I @CAPS8 you to run around the house three times"" or ""@CAPS9 you ever kissed someone?"". Nothing unrated about that. After a while everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do which was to play sing-star on the @NUM5, but @LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords over so we couldn't hook the console up. Since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @CAPS1. Since this was our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"", it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @CAPS1. For our @CAPS1 role, it goes like this, I am the father, @PERSON3 is the mother, @LOCATION3 is the cat, @PERSON8 is the @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @CAPS13 and @PERSON6 were my children, @PERSON1 is my brother, @PERSON7 is the strange atrocious woman, @PERSON4 is the sister in-law, and @LOCATION2 is our cable guy. This is how we all considered each other in the @CAPS1, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering to each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot. After photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM6 different large pizzas. Hawaiian, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2, and @CAPS20. One by one, we all kept coming back for more. My ""daughter"" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. We all started to pother. @PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, and @PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life. After the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. Now it was @CAPS23 movie time. Snuggled up onto the couch with @NUM1 people all clutched together is the ""right"" way to contemplate a @CAPS23 movie. The movie we chose was called The @CAPS24. Every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then, that's when it all happened... when @PERSON4 got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS25 turned off, all the lights in the house shut down and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @CAPS13 started to cry, @LOCATION2 was complaining, @PERSON4 wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I was freaking out. Since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. Most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. There was one story that @PERSON6 portrayed about a possessed @CAPS26 that had no left leg and would go around terrorizing pedestrians. Well, it just so happened that I had a @LOCATION1 that had no left leg and when we started telling that story my @LOCATION1 started to freak out and assail all of my guests. So I grabbed my dog whistle and commanded them to cease, and dismiss. After all of the commotion, my parents never woke up and we all scurried up to my room to continue our discussion of @CAPS23 stories. During the whole process of the @CAPS2, the main lesson was that you can conquer any kind of fear as long as you @CAPS9 a sense of laughter and friends to back you up with it and that's what happened at the party. We were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter. By far I would @CAPS9 to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties I @CAPS9 ever had."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20766	8	" Laughter and exuberance are key elements in any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and joyful with someone close to @CAPS11 is a sign of comfort. It often can bring people closer and help to solidify their friendships. Your true self is shown in your humor. Two years ago when I was in @PERSON1's seventh grade math class at @ORGANIZATION1, I was chosen to be in the @ORGANIZATION2 along with just three other classmates. Being in the @ORGANIZATION2 simply meant that we would be teaching ourselves @CAPS1-@CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @PERSON1 would teach the rest of the class an easier, more simple math. The @ORGANIZATION2 was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked upon us with jealousy because we got to sit in the back of the classroom together, never had to do any homework, and were never called upon out of the blue to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh graders that we were, we abused @TIME1 incredible opportunity that we had. I became fast friends with the three other people in the @ORGANIZATION2. Their names were @PERSON4, @PERSON3, and @CAPS3. @PERSON4 and I were already friends, but it was working together in the @ORGANIZATION2 that really brought us closer together. I also became close with @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3. To @TIME1 day, @PERSON4 is one of my very best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. @PERSON3 was caught up in the popular crowd, @CAPS3 usually hung out with the really smart kids who were into chess and reading books, and @PERSON4 and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence.  We each felt that the work we were teaching ourselves was much too easy. We breezed right through the book and never really had any questions. In doing @CAPS8, we always finished our assigned work quickly and had more than half of the class left to just sit there, eat, and goof off. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's the order things played out in. ""@PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math @DATE2. I'm beat,"" I complained as we walked into @PERSON1's room for math right after lunch. ""@CAPS6 neither,"" she replied. ""I say we just sit there and make it look like we're doing work."" We made our way to the table in the back where @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 were already sitting. They had their books, pencils, and spirals out, but sat there with vacant expressions. @PERSON4 and I joined them in sitting and we all exchanged disgruntled looks. ""@CAPS8 uh, I was talking to @LOCATION1 @TIME1 and he said that we don't have to do any work @DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out,"" I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching on, @CAPS3 and @PERSON3 grinned. @PERSON3 turned around and pulled a brown paper bag out of her backpack. She began to pull food out of the bag and offered it all up to us. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Midway through eating it, I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big blob of it on the window behind @CAPS6. @PERSON4 noticed and immediately started to chuckle. ""@CAPS10, what's that?!"" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear. @PERSON1 and a few classmates glanced over briefly, but got back to the lesson instantly. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. ""@CAPS11 guys, I had @TIME1 crazy dream @TIME2,"" @PERSON3 said as the laughter died down. ""I went to @TIME1 @DATE1 camp thing, and @PERSON2 was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with blue pinstripes. Oh, and he also had a clipboard!"" We stared at her blankly and then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about @TIME1, was that @PERSON2 often substituted for our teachers, and he wore that exact outfit each time. But the even funnier thing was that it really wasn't funny at all. We were @CAPS8 desperate for a good time, we found chocolate blobs on windows and khaki pants to be hilarious. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly, @CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately broke, dropping him right to the ground. To anyone else, @TIME1 would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, staring at one another. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt sympathy, but simply ironic that obsolete things sent us into fits of giggles, while a substantial, laughable event made us simply sit there. I don't think I'll ever forget the @ORGANIZATION2. Though it was a waste of time, we had many good laughs. We @MONTH1 not have learned a lot about math, but we learned a lot about each other."	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20767	8	"Many @CAPS1 to laughter People always say that laughing can have many benefits. The truth, I believe, is that laughter is not always the best thing. Laughing can have many different meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles,happiness, and memories. Although, there is one memory of laughter that does not prove that to be true. ""@CAPS2, I really don't wanna be here. I don't know that I can stay here and tell him this,"" I pleaded to @CAPS11 mother to @CAPS6 me go back home. ""@CAPS3 need to do this honey. @CAPS8's for the best."" @CAPS4 that point I had always though @CAPS11 mother knew best. Now, I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back tears, waiting for @CAPS11 father to get back to his house. I knew he was at the bar, and silently thanked him that I had time to think.  I was supposed to go tell him how I felt about him always drinking alcohol. Every time I went over there I saw him either drunk, or on his way there. The truth is, I was scared. I was scared for his health and scared that I was the reason for his drinking. I was getting older and needed to tell him what I thought and how I felt. While distracted by this realization, he came storming through the door. I looked up at @CAPS11 drunk father and @CAPS11 heart dropped. I burst out in tears while @CAPS11 mother held me in her arms. ""@CAPS5...@CAPS8's alright,"" she soothed. @CAPS11 father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked in the room where he was and watched cautiously at him through the open doorway. He wasn't the man @CAPS11 mother had once married anymore. He had became a monster.  I couldn't stand @CAPS8 anymore. I walked into the room where @CAPS11 mother waited with worry in her eyes. ""@CAPS6's go home,"" I said. On the way home I sobbed until @CAPS11 shirt was streaked with tears. The car ride home was silent and the thoughts and sadness hung thick in the air. I could barely sleep that night. The sun shone down on @CAPS11 face as I awoke to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @CAPS11 @CAPS9 how I've felt all along. We drove back to his house and when we pulled into the drive way, nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled up to the door and knocked. ""@CAPS7. Hey."" @CAPS8 made me upset that @CAPS11 father was acting as if nothing was wrong. I walked in, with confidence, and asked him to sit down. I was content with the fact that I had caught him in one of this rare moments of not being drunk.  ""@CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel as though @CAPS3 are making a huge mistake by drinking. I know @CAPS10 addicted and there are risks with stopping but @CAPS3're also endangering @CAPS10 health!"" I basically screamed at him. I poured out @CAPS11 heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @CAPS11 father sat there with a blank look pasted on his face. He laughed. ""@CAPS10 mother told @CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @CAPS8. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 doesn't know what she's talking about."" @CAPS11 jaw dropped as he acted as though this wasn't serious. Anger boiled in me.  ""@CAPS3 don't even know me! @CAPS3 don't even care about me!"" I screamed then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked straight at @CAPS11 mother and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave.  This time the car ride, again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about how laughter is almost always a great thing, I started to cry because, just once, laughing didn't mean happiness. @CAPS8 meant tears."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20768	8	"                          Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5, we've got something to tell @CAPS3."" I knew @CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew that @CAPS8 they went into the other room, @CAPS6 wasn't for some quality time together. They were getting a divorce @CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew that they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words ""We are getting a divorce,"" rang in my head like church bells @CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @CAPS3 could ever hear. But that was the exact opposite of @CAPS9 was going on right now. As I looked up into the face of my mother, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue, gray mixture used to meet @CAPS11 become one, @CAPS6 had turned red @CAPS11 irritated. @CAPS6 killed me inside to see her crying, @CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch near me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell that he was thinking that he was so in love @CAPS11 that @CAPS6 all just went downhill, leaving him with an intense feeling of resentment @CAPS11 anger towards my mother. The love of his life, was now his enemy.  At seven I couldn't fully wrap my mind around @CAPS9 was happening to our family. I got that one parent would move away, that I wouldn't always get tucked into bed at night by a duo of love, I just didn't understand @CAPS7 this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they possibly explain this to him. If I was confused, he had to of been off on another planet. At the thought of my family crumbling before my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles occurring at home. If a genie had been there to grant my three wishes, I would of used all three of them if I thought there would be a possibility to save my parents relationship.  Crying just seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say ,""@CAPS6's not your fault, don't blame yourself, this is between your father @CAPS11 I."" @CAPS7 did they think those statements made @CAPS6 better? Because @CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen out of love with each other, @CAPS11 the hope I had that they would get back together was diminishing faster than the amount of rain forest left in @LOCATION1. Plus, there was still the underlying factor that my home was broken. @CAPS11 more importantly than my home, my heart. @CAPS6 was broken @CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue in the whole world to pull the pieces back together.  Just @CAPS8 @CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to crash down upon me, my mother said something to me that I @CAPS1 never forget. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh. Remember all the good times that we spent together as afamily."" One by one, each memory began to flood back into my mind. @CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves we had collectively raked. The time @CAPS8 mom @CAPS11 I made sugar cookies in the winter that ended up burnt, but still made the whole house feel warm @CAPS11 familiar. @CAPS11 especially the wedding that brought the two of them together in matrimony. That sacred bond that only ministers can ensue on people. The one that forever changed their lives @CAPS11 mine.  I began to laugh, @CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @CAPS9 to think about my sudden change of emotion. They asked ,""@CAPS9's wrong, @CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 I, still thinking that none of these memories would be had again, I then realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, that we would still laugh. That @CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spewing out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @CAPS11 the realization had finally set in that we would be okay. That with laughter in our lives, @CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this.  From then on, i solely believed in that one statement spoken to me by my mother. ""@CAPS8 @CAPS3 feel like crying, laugh."" The statement that said to me, @CAPS6's okay to be sad, but that as long as @CAPS3 have laughter in your life, everything @CAPS1 be alright. In my heart, I applauded my mom for handling that situation so well. If @CAPS6 had not been for her, I would of kept on with the water works @CAPS11 never stopped for just a second to think about all the hilarious times we had had together. So, as far as laughter goes, don't forget to just take a moment out of every day to remember each punch line to every corny joke, @CAPS6 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4."	20	25		45				4	4	5	5	4	4	5	5	6	5	5	5						
20769	8	" Laughter, the sense of pure happiness. You are in the moment @CAPS1 nothing else matters, all your worries @CAPS1 stress fall away leaving you with your true happy self. Have you ever had those moments when everything seem too much? Then a friend says something that makes you laugh, once your done laughing you start to cry because it felt so good to laugh. Or when you laugh so hard you fall to the floor @CAPS1 can't get up for what seems hours? Yet looking back you forget what was so funny. Laughter is magical, @CAPS7 behind love. Those two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just you boyfriend/girlfriend but you friends @CAPS1 family too, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, @CAPS1 that brings you even closer together. When I'm with @CAPS16 friends the one thing we seem to do most is laugh. We laugh about anything @CAPS1 everything that is even slightly funny. It bring us closer together, sharing a moment of joy. The six of us are very close @CAPS1 will be friends after high @ORGANIZATION1 is over, even if we go to colleges a thousands of miles away. It is because we have shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other @CAPS1 can share anything with them even our most important secrets. This story is how we came to be so close. Brightly colored fancy dresses @CAPS1 killer high heels were splayed out across the room. Open soda cans @CAPS1 chip bags. The faint smell of nail polish, flowery perfume, @CAPS1 deodorant lingering in the air. Laughter @CAPS1 giggles bubbling through out the room with the occasional squeal. Pitch black outside but light @CAPS1 warm in. Six of us lounging around the room. Smeared makeup @CAPS1 deflating hair. Sweat pants @CAPS1 baggy t-shirts. We all went from looking our very best to... not, within a few minutes. Yet not one of us cared. We when looking at each other we were able to @CAPS17 past appearances had fun with each other, not their looks. We had just gotten back from the @ORGANIZATION1. None of us had had dates but we still managed to have the time of our lives. ""@CAPS1 did you see him! He was dancing with her!"" ""I wouldn't really call that dancing...."" she made a pelvic thrust, we all burst into a new round of giggles @CAPS1 shouted stuff like, ""@CAPS2, get a room!"" We gossiped about what we saw, who was with who, pretty dresses, hot @CAPS4, creeper @CAPS4, slow dances, the music, even our @CAPS8 we hid our cups so we would know which one was ours when we wanted to use it again.We had all been friends, but recently we had been becoming closer. Starting to move from friends to best friends.  It was at least @NUM1 @CAPS3. Everyone was exhausted but was forcing themselves to stay up with caffeine @CAPS1 sugar. You @MONTH1 ask why, but I'm not really sure. Maybe because we always seem to have so much to talk about, because we enjoy each others company, or just because we can, so why not?""@CAPS4 I think we need a picture, a picture of the six of us."" I said.""@CAPS5!"" ""@CAPS6""""@CAPS7 now? I'm a mess!""""I've got just the thing!"" @PERSON1 takes off running upstairs to grab something.""@CAPS8 should we sit?""""@CAPS9 the bed?""""@CAPS10, @CAPS5! Scoot over fatties""""@CAPS11! I'm not fat, I'm festively plump!"" We all cracked up to the reference of @LOCATION1 as we stared to squeeze into a corner of the squishy full size bed. @PERSON1 @CAPS1 @PERSON1's mom arrive back into the room. @PERSON1 was carrying a old @ORGANIZATION2 camera that print out the picture immediately after you took it. She gave the camera to her mom @CAPS1 jumped @CAPS9 to the bed. We all squished together, barely enough room to breathe.""One...Two...Three!"" @CAPS12! the picture came out. ""@CAPS13 take one more while the first is developing. Again, one... two... three!"" @CAPS14! @CAPS12! ""@CAPS15!!!"" We all screamed in unison. The bed broke! we had broken the bed! We all sat there clinging to each other in total shock.""@CAPS16 bed! You @CAPS4 are faaaaat..."" @PERSON1 said while trying to contain a giggle. Suddenly we were in hysterics. Even @PERSON1's mom was laughing. We were one big throbbing pile of laughter. Only the corner of the bed had broken so we were all pulled down into that corner. Then someone started tickling, it was war. Every girl for themselves. It was a mass of bedsheets, wiggling fingers, bare feet, biting @CAPS1 a whole lot of laughing. ""@CAPS17 the pictures have developed."" The first one showed us sitting together smiling, but the second one was taken just as the bed broke. It showed the shock @CAPS9 our faces as we held onto each other for support.

20770	8	" Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things @MONTH1 not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You @MONTH1 think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people @MONTH1 find very simple things considerably amusing, but others @MONTH1 be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us. And regardless of the way you @MONTH1 interpret laughter's abstract form, you've got to admit: it's kind of funny."	21	18		39				4	4	4	5	5	4	3	3	3	4	4	4

I was so hurt I told him I just wanted to be alone and he understood. As he was walking away he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoonSpongebob @CAPS1, when @ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his entire back-side was drenched. His cheeks were cherry-red with embarrassment. I just busted out laughing, I couldn't help @CAPS7. He saw that water had gotten all over me, then he started laughing. That was a moment of comfort brought on by laughter. Whenever we had a promblem, we could always laugh @CAPS7 off. That's actually how I met him. I was hanging out with a couple of my friends and we decided to go see a movie calledStep-@CAPS2. There was this one seen where one of the characters said, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny, last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur,"" then other character looked like he was going to cry. I thought that was so funny. After the movie was over my friend @PERSON1 suggested that we go back to his house. When we got there, @CAPS4 was waiting on the steps for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 stood back a second then said, ""aw were you waiting for me little one."" @CAPS4 replied with, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS3 that was so funny , last time I heard that I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur."" I laughed so hard I almost went the bathroom on myself. @CAPS4 and myself were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny I can honestly say I would've never been with him. I love laughter. I believe @CAPS7's the easiest way to trigger the best emotions."	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	4

When we were walking @CAPS3 cheer-leading practice on a @DATE1 @TIME1. We had a good laugh going @CAPS3 @NUM1 and I were getting cold, because we were in shorts and sweatshirts, @CAPS8 we put on @CAPS1 hoods. @CAPS6 @PERSON3 wanted @CAPS3 put her hood up also @CAPS8 she didn't feel lonely, but her hood was @CAPS3 small and with thick hair it just made it worse for her. @CAPS8 she tired @CAPS3 put her hood on anyways and her hair went on the top of her head and her curls are at the bottom of her hair. @CAPS8 when when she put her hood on it made her look like a poodle.When we got @CAPS3 the end of the block that I live on @PERSON1 said her foot was hurting, @CAPS8 i told her i would give her a piggy back ride. @CAPS8 she got onto my back, and i told her @CAPS13 we get @CAPS3 the end of this block set me down and we can cross the street @CAPS6 give me a piggy back ride, @CAPS8 @PERSON1 gave me a piggy back ride. @CAPS8 when we crossed and @CAPS6 we told @PERSON3 that it was her turn @CAPS3 give one of us a piggy back ride, i was about @CAPS3 get on @PERSON3's back the @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS5 just got a turn!

We finally got @CAPS3 the doors @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS12 everyone is here today!""  @CAPS8 that is a time that i had a good laugh with more @CAPS6 just one person.

We had one class together. Which was called @CAPS2. Passing each other in the hallway just would make my @DATE1. We met in a class that we both didn't care for. I would ask him for help even though I didn't need it just so I could talk to him. We also would see each other at the swimming pool because his brother swam and I did also. I would see him during the @DATE1 but not very often. Instead of him ""helping"" me we would sit and talk about our lives how they were at school and at home.  First semester is over and he got moved out of the class to another class period. We would still talk at the pool and see each during the school @DATE1. He would now give me hugs in the hallway. We started to become really close friends. Talking drew us even closer. Laughing was big part in our conversations. We found out that we have a lot in common. Like hunting, wheeling, foods, favorite dog and our personalities are so much alike, that it seems as if we grew up around each other. @MONTH1 came around one more month of school. I started to go to his house every once in awhile. He came to mine more often. In the beginning of @DATE4 strawberry festival came around and I asked him to go with me. He said okay and his parents also went but with my parents. That @DATE3 was fun and enjoyable. The end of @DATE4 was finally here, school was out in a @DATE1. Summer break was here. The @DATE1 @DATE1 of school was fun. It was going to be so nice not to have homework over the @DATE3 or during the week. All we did the @DATE1 of school was sign @CAPS1 books and tell funny stories about the school @CAPS1. After school I went to swim practice and after practice he was still at the pool waiting for his brother. We were outside talking and all the sudden out of know where he asked me ""will you go out with me""? I said... yes! He made me one of the happiest girls in the world that @DATE1. Today, in @DATE2 we are still dating. One and only relationship I have ever had. I hope we @DATE1. He tells me almost every @DATE1 that he is going to marry me. He tells me he doesn't know what he would do with out me. I told everyone I swore I was falling in love. Now everyone knows I fell in love. I fell in love at first sight. We talk and laugh all the time we hardly ever argue."	17	17		34				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20774	8	"When I was younger I liked to go fishing a lot. I always went with my two friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON1.We loved to catch @CAPS1, @CAPS2 head, and sometimes @CAPS3. We did a lot of fishing while we were camping. One day when we were fishing for @CAPS2 head and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @PERSON1 hooked one on his last cast. He yelled t me that he was going to catch this on so I jumped off the four-wheeler and ran over to him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @CAPS1. It was by far the biggest @CAPS2 head that we have ever seen.  While he was reeling it in he said that it was very strong and I could see that he was having trouble. After a few minutes he started to get the fish by the shore. We all started to relax and think that the day was going to be good now. Right as @PERSON1 told me to get the net he slipped and fell right in the river and he let go of the pole.At this time I thought we lost a fish and a pole but @PERSON1 was not thinking straight and he jumped in the water after the pole.   Once @PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water after a pole and I was almost to it. Right as I got about a foot from the pole the fish started to swim faster. While I was trying to get the pole I was not focused on where I was going and I got caught on a tree so it was up to @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 to get the pole.  The chase for the floating fishing pole had now gone on for over five minutes and all of us were very far down the river. Now @PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @PERSON1 and I were just catching up to him. Suddenly, @PERSON2 yelled that he got the pole so we all swam to the shore to reel in the fish. At this time we were very happy that we went in the ice cold river to after this fish and we could not wait to get home and dry. After a few minutes @PERSON2 was still reeling in the huge fish. He said he did not know how he was going to get it to the shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @PERSON2 jerked the pole as hard as he could to get it onto the bank but as he pulled the line broke and the fish got away. All of our hard work was not for anything. After that we decided that it was time to just go home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story think it is funny but personally i don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. One good thing is that this was the most memorable day of fishing I had ever had."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20775	8	" One time when i was spending the night at @ORGANIZATION1's she wanted to sleep oustide in a tent. @CAPS2 was @DATE1 and we always tryed seeing eachother anytime possible because she had to go back to boarding school alot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went ouside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and i was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. @CAPS2 was like two best friends dating two bestfriends, and we were closer then ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the @TIME1 so @CAPS2 was just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point i was just cracking up with laughfter, @ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd her self while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happend, so all of this was going on at around one in the @TIME1 and i was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When i looked over and saw that she had pee'd her self i yelled out ""@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION1!"" @CAPS2 was the most funniest thing, i dont think i have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said ""@CAPS3 should probably go take care of that,"" and then they got off the phone. She was really embarassed after that, i mean i would be too if that happend to me."	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20776	8	"@ORGANIZATION1 is one of the many joys I love to share with people. I absolutely love to laugh, I don't know where i would be if I didn't laugh. My cousin; @CAPS1 and I, are usually together for most of the @DATE1 and the truth is we are not supposed to have energy drinks. @CAPS1's dad; @PERSON1, gave us a monster to split and that day we were going to @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1. After about ten minutes of us drinking the whole monster, me being the one who drank most of it, was the one who was staying calm. @CAPS1 on the other hand, who drank a couple of sips, was going crazy. She was running down the aisles and tripping over her own feet. She almost tipped the cart over with me on the end of it. @ORGANIZATION1 hysterically for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy; @PERSON1's wife and my second cousin started to get hungry, so we went to go eat pizza at the @ORGANIZATION2 cafe that is there. My mom had called me and I was trying to get my phone from my pocket to answer while trying to hold on to my plate of hot pizza. I handed my plate to @CAPS1 because my plate was slipping from my grip. She was holding her food in her other hand, she felt the bottom of my plate and said it was really hot so she passed it off to @PERSON1 who wasn't paying attention and he didn't have a good hold on it and my pizza dropped on the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing everybody was looking at us. After that embarrassing moment, @PERSON1 realized that he forgot the churos, so he told @CAPS1 to go get them. All three of us realized his mistake as soon as @CAPS1 left, cause @CAPS1 is a klutz and we probably jinxed it by saying "@CAPS1 is probably going to drop them". We were a little surprised that she hadn't dropped them yet, as soon as we thought that and she set them on the table, one of the churos fell off the table and rolled out of the package. We were @ORGANIZATION1 so hard that we couldn't breathe. @CAPS1 was so embarrassed by her mistake that she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @CAPS1, but we couldn't help but laugh because of how funny it was. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things i usually say is if you can't and aren't willing to laugh at yourself then you aren't having fun. That's why i believe it is so important to laugh cause you gotta learn how to have fun when it is in a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but yet aren't wanting to. That's one of the biggest ways to have fun is by @ORGANIZATION1, because you know you made a small silly mistake that you think everyone in the world saw, all you need is to laugh it off. But you wont cause you feel too embarrassed or too ashamed to admit that you made a little mistake. Sometimes it's your job to go over to them, pat them on the back and tell them that everybody makes mistakes, you gotta learn how to be silly in a tough situation, and that nobody is perfect. Tell them to laugh it off, it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down just get back up cause that's what life is all about. That's the only way you can learn from your mistakes and from life as well. Laughter is really important the more you laugh the better you feel and the better you feel the more fun you will have. Laughter fixes everything, it is a bandage for the little things that happen in life."	18	15		33				4	3	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20777	8	"                 A @CAPS1 @CAPS2  I once heard ""laughter is the best medicine."" I believe that is true. I could laugh all day long, finding anything @CAPS9 everything funny in @CAPS3 world. Laughter is important to me, without it, life would be boring. Sometimes Laughter is good @CAPS9 comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @CAPS9 mean. I like to avoid the cruel @CAPS9 mean laughter, @CAPS9 just stick to the good laughter. When one of my friends is laughing @CAPS9 smiling, it makes me want to know @CAPS10 they're laughing about, so I can laugh too.  Birthdays are fun, laughing usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @CAPS2, I decided to have a party at my house. I wanted it to be very special so I invited my closest friends, @CAPS9 my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @CAPS9 I are pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we are both the same age for a little while. We always have a good time, both of us acting crazy @CAPS9 always laughing. For my party my mom made rainbow sherbert punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @CAPS9 soon the party was over, but, my cousins were not leaving until the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen getting more punch, my cousin came in @CAPS9 wanted some more too. I poured both of us a glass. ""@CAPS3 is so good!"" my cousin @PERSON1 said. ""I know that's why I had my mom make it"" "" @CAPS4 you wanna hear a joke?"" ""@CAPS5."" @PERSON1 said. ""@CAPS6, @CAPS7 once was a kid named butt itches, he was really sick @CAPS9 one day died, his mom cried to the doctor,""@CAPS8 my poor butt itches!"" ""@CAPS9 @CAPS12, @CAPS4 you wanna know @CAPS10 the doctor said?"" ""@CAPS10?"" @CAPS11 @PERSON1. ""@CAPS12 itch it!"" @PERSON1 had just took a drink of punch when I said @CAPS3. She spit the punch out of her mouth while laughing, it got all over me. Usually when someone spits, or spills something on you, you get mad. I started cracking up laughing, @CAPS9 so did she. ""@CAPS8 my gosh! That's so gross."" ""@NUM1 @CAPS9 I could not stop laughing. The joke was not that funny, it was the punch all over me @CAPS9 the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before even realizing that both our moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just staring at us wondering @CAPS10 in the world had happened.  You would think that getting punch spitted at your face, on your @CAPS2, would make you mad. @CAPS3 is why laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case laughter was the shortest distance between @PERSON1 @CAPS9 I. It would have to be short for her to get that much punch on me. Laughter made @CAPS3 @CAPS2 extra special, because I will never forget my twelfth @CAPS2."	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20778	8	" @CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10 , @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and now even @CAPS2 ( @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5). Laughter! some say it is the best median. It can brighten a cloudy day, cure a case of the blues, and even sooth a breaking heart.  On the other hand a simple sinker or soft giggle can break a heart to! I have had first hand experience listening to goofy squeals being thrown my way and not because I told a witty joke simply just for siting, siting in my @NUM1 grade class room and becoming the but of my pears jokes. Before I go on with this story there are a few things @CAPS6 must know. Let alone that all @NUM1 graders have a common undeniable erg to bring people down so they can build them self's up. I was a @NUM1 grader who's weight had reached the point at witch my doctors were telling me ""@CAPS6 should look in to a weight loss program."" this news alone was crushing my self a steam and my class mates laughter soon brought me to tears. I can recall a particular @CAPS7, perhaps one of the worst. I was on the buss and almost home when @NUM4 girls who i thought were my friends started laughing. Little did I know it was me they were laughing at so I joined in what i thought, and what seamed to be some @CAPS8 giggling. Suddenly they stopped, looked at me started whispering to each other then one of the girls blurted @CAPS4 between chuckles ""@CAPS6 look like a beached wail!"". She said this so @CAPS5 the whole buss herd and immediately burst in to side spiting laughter. I walked down the same street i walked down every day were the buss dropped me off. That day it seamed more gloomy then ever before. This is the day I decided I was never going to set foot on the buss again! It is encounters with laughter like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation towards loosing weight and regaining confidence. Days, weeks, months, even years have passed scene that day in the @NUM1 grade. I'm @NUM6 pounds lighter, a varsity cheerleader and proved of who I am. The tables have turned for me in many ways. I am no longer the person who gets laughed at because of my weight, but some times i catch my self sometimes mindlessly cracking a joke or two at some one else expense. I can recall just the other day, I was with my best friend at the mall. She spotted this girl who was over weight and immediately started giggling and elbowing me in the side trying to draw my attention to her like she was some freak show. When I saw the girl my first reaction was a hideous @CAPS3 but just as soon as I did so i felt the same pain I felt when that buss full of my pears laughed at me. I immediately stopped, realizing the pain my laughter could have brought her. My self, I am a very funny person and will do just about any thing for a @CAPS3. But when it comes to laughing at people and hurting there feelings this is were i draw the line because i know how it feels to be in there position and i hope that my story helps open the eyes of u and others to the harmful effects some laughter can have. So go ahead and @CAPS10 @CAPS10 @CAPS10, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 @CAPS1, and even @CAPS2 just not at the expense of another persons feelings."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
20779	8	" Laughter is a big part of my life and I believe @CAPS1 have to have laughter in a good and healthy relationship. This is a true story about laughter and it's affects on my life.Laughter is a good thing for your body, mind and soul, it lightens my mood when I'm feeling down. I'm glad to say I have lots of relationships, many of which are blessed with laughter. My mother and I have a good relationship together, and almost any time we're together in the same room there is bound to be laughter. My mother and I laugh all the time, over silly things. We laugh just to laugh and most of the time, we don't even know what we're laughing at. She can make me laugh at the most ridiculous things. I'm also pretty sure she's the only person who can get me to spit my drink all over the dash board just because of a silly face she made.  My mother isn't the only one I can have a good time with. I remember a conversation I had with a good friend of mine, it was about the way people laughed. I told her about how I had noticed that people usually laughed in different vowel sounds, like a, e and o. It seemed odd to me that I had only ever heard people laughing in those vowels and not I and u. She thought the same thing I did, so we came up with this idea to laugh in the vowels I and u. Of course people were too busy with their own lives to notice us laughing oddly, but it was fun all the same. @CAPS1 never really realize how hard it is to not laugh until the occasion is upon @CAPS1. My mom and I were at my aunts house trying desperately not too laugh. We had all decided to do a facial cleansing mask we had seen on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The mask itself was made out of whisked egg whites and toilet paper. @CAPS1 dip the toilet paper in the egg whites and plaster it all over your face. @CAPS1 have to wait at least fifteen minutes or until it's completely dry before @CAPS1 can take it off, other wise it doesn't work.   The three of us did as the instructions told us, but were dismayed when we saw the final results of our efforts. We weren't upset because we looked repulsive we were upset because we all looked like a bunch of crazy ladies, and we found it exceedingly difficult not to burst into laughter. The site of my mother and aunt was so ridiculously funny I had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry. After about fifteen minutes I came back to find my mother and aunt in the bathroom drying each others face with a hair dryer. After seeing this I just couldn't stand it any longer, I started crying with laughter, my mask cracked and all my hard work went down the drain. that day was one of the funniest days of my life, we laughed together so hard our abdomens hurt. I love to laugh as I've said before and I personally have many different forms of laughter. when I laugh really hard I laugh all the air out of my lungs and forget to breathe. What it looks like to others I have no clue but I must be a red faced girl rocking back and forth. Other times I kind of have a manly ha ha but if your lucky @CAPS1'll get to hear me snort. The thing I'm trying to say is that laughter is a good thing and it has made a big difference in my life, I don't know what I would do without it. I love to laugh, I think I would die if I couldn't laugh."	20	17		37				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	3						
20781	8	" The laughter in me.  To me all you need to do to get through a tough and horrible day is a good @CAPS5. It gives you hope throughout the day, and no matter what kind of mood your in, when leaving to work, going to school, or really any activity that involves a ""sigh"" moment. For me I get that feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @PERSON1. Everyday she manages to say something totally off topic and we'd end up dying of laughter at the top of the stairs near the science labs were we eat lunch. As people walk by they give us weird looks, we don't care because we understand each other. To me @CAPS9 is my way of reliving stress.My @CAPS1 agrees with me her name is @CAPS2 I call her @ORGANIZATION1. We've been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working at some fast food restaurant. I hang out a lot at her at her house and we share so many great and fun memories. Its really bad when we are around each other, its like one look at each other and boom!, I'm on the floor not breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is but, its like when we see each other its a rush off all the good times we've spent coming together all at once. Sometimes we @CAPS5 hysterically over nothing. I doesn't make sense but I guess that doesn't matter when your hanging with your best bud.  Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. Its shows me how fun a person can be and if the have a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and not some stuck up want to be perfect robot. All @PERSON1 and I talk about is boys and boy problems and it makes me @CAPS5 and giggle, but when we are in our fifth period class forestry and fire we are like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we are magically ""high,"" all of a sudden have this out burst of energy. We sit next to sit side by side to one another and we tickle each other and @CAPS5 really loud. By the end of class I make a paper ball and we play paper soccer ball its fun especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop and you don't do it. Lets just say that her face turns a very bright red color.Nothing compares to how much I @CAPS5 when I'm with @ORGANIZATION1. When I used to go to @CAPS3 I had three classes with her @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4. We also had lunch together, but anyway as I was saying, I swear we had a not stop @CAPS9 war everyday. My @CAPS5 is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like, some thinks its cute, others think I @CAPS5 funny( The weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2 she'd stand next to me and she'd look at me weird, or said something that didn't come out right, or sang obnoxiously, anything she did cracked me up it was so distracted when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from @CAPS9 with her. At home when my family is all together, are way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It's different than laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS6 was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mothers stomach. We made fun of my brother for being the only boy out of five kids. We make fun of my sister @PERSON2 for being the shortest one in our family. I can feel the difference between laughter. It's mostly criticism really.I @CAPS5 mostly because I feel more alive it gives me something to live for everyday in stead of ""@CAPS7 great, another day to try to get through, @CAPS8...no."" @CAPS9 for me gets me motivated for the day it's like my drug to get through life. It gives me an easy way in to communicate with others. I thank @CAPS10 for giving us the ability to @CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. ""That's how I make friends I @CAPS5.""  "	15	20	40	40				4	3	4	4	2	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

As I stared at the majestic destruction of the warm, humid air, I felt someone or something watching me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of wood started to get heavy as I walked from one side of the house to the other. Finally, I reached the trailer just to be told by @PERSON4, my best friends mom, the she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought to myself the this was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows, and tents we headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, that felt like twenty minutes. @PERSON3, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and I were the worst group of people to put into one car. We all yell and fight and punch at each other just for fun. Once we arrived at our destination, we sprung out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I race @PERSON2 to the @ORGANIZATION1. the second we were done unpacking our belongings. The first few days were spent basking in the one hundred degree heat, swimming, and flirting with the random girls we found around the camp site. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and just pure fun we were having. During day two, we decided to go mountain biking. We were on those bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was going down. In the moment we all turned and saw the most extravagant view the earth has ever created. There were burst of orange and red. The colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of riding our bikes in the heat, we chose to go for a swim. As we swam I felt something touching my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was only a stick. As I looked closer, it turned out to be a root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, as if someone or something had put it there. This though sparked a conversation about @CAPS2 for the day to come.  The sparks danced together as if they were @CAPS4 and the @LOCATION1. The only light we had was the brilliant glow of the fire. @PERSON3 was playing a gorgeous melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the flawlessness of nature, I felt someone watching me from behind. I nudged @PERSON3 and when we turned around, our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, almost twenty feet in the air. I spoke the word everyone was dreading, @CAPS2. I had slowly stood up and the light started spinning faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, that was next to me, and approached the light. As I grew closer, I could make out small figured in the @CAPS1 shadows. Then, an eruption of children laughing came booming from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control is laughter, and ran away. After returning to my seat next to the camp fire, I thought about life. What if @CAPS2 were real and they are watching us. No, there not real. I laughed it off, and continued my week long vacation."	18	15		33				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20784	8	" What makes you laugh? Laughter is a really good stress reliever. There are many different types of laughs around the world, some people's laughs are really high pitched and others @MONTH1 be very deep and low. Some other people snort and make other animal noises. I know that for me I have many different types of laughs for all the different emotions I feel. When I am upset I have a very distinctive laugh. Although when I am upset I laugh to make myself feel better and have a better day.   One time during a basketball game, I was having a really off night. Fouls were being called on me left and right. Normally when this happens to me, I get really mad and I lose my head and end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench. I absolutely hate sitting on the bench. This time when I got a foul called on me after already being threatened to be ejected from the previous game for the same reason. I decided to just smile and laugh about the foul and told myself to shake it off. My coach was very pleased with my change in attitude and just told me to play defense with my feet and to shake the bad call off and keep my head. When you are mad a person can take a lot away from the demonstrative looks you can make, although if you just smile and laugh about it, their reactions will be a lot different. I am not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way. A lot of us just laugh about calls that are made and just shake them off.  I am also a cheerleader. When you are a cheerleader you should always try to have a smile on your face at all times, and make it seem like you are in a happy mood. I play in a basketball game every night before I go out and cheer. I have to do my best to keep my cool while playing so that I'm in a good mood for after my game when I do cheer. Laughing helps me a lot with keeping my cool and relaxing while I am playing, so I'm in a good mood for cheer.  My coach is also very huge on people having positive attitudes. She tells us at practice that if we just smile and laugh about things that go wrong the outcome will be a lot better then if we have bad attitudes about it. I took this in very strongly and it stayed with me. My coach inflenced me to have a better attitude and since that day I have tried to have a positive attitude. I keep my positive attitude by just smiling and laughing when things in my life go wrong.  A laugh can go a really long way. I personally think laughing helps express the mood you are in. Laughing is also good for the body. Laughing can make you feel one hundred times better when you are feeling down in the dumps. I try my hardest to be in a good mood at all times. I really don't like being in a bad mood, it's really not fun. Laughing makes me feel a lot better.  I think that laughing is a very good function for the body. I feel that when I laugh it makes my mood better and the moods of the people around me a lot better. Laughing is a magical feeling that goes through out your body and makes you feel warm inside. I think everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will make your day that much better."	17	20		37				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20785	8	" Laughter is the so called ""best medicine"". I do not believe that to be true, however my nephew @MONTH1 have other thoughts. My nephew was ""sick"" for every school day for two weeks. ""@CAPS1 just doesn't like school"", I would tell his grandma. The thought of school being no fun and not liking it changed drastically for my nephew.  We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was party day for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they get a party, lucky for @CAPS2 they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing it's ugly face that morning as @CAPS1 fought every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door @PERSON1 did something uncharacteristic, to him and five year old's all over the @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 stood as still and silent as a marble statue. It couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats, and bags, they went all out for the first one of the year. The aroma made my stomach gurgle with desire. Above all they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all of this cooked thirty feet from you. so you walk through that door and you mouth instantly fills with warm saliva. These children played with a ninja like ability, one moment in front of you, you blink, and just as fast as you blinked they disappeared. It took me an hour at least to find @PERSON1 in that small room. As I realized though it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt hit the cold, hard, and nearly unbearable surface @PERSON1 was in front of me. @CAPS1 had this ear to ear grin on his face that scared me, @CAPS1 never had that big of a grin on his face unless @CAPS1 had a plan. @CAPS1 definitely had a plan, in seconds my face was soaked.  @CAPS1 had been concealing a squirt gun behind his back, and had the escape route planned out. With the chairs and the short tables how they sat long legs and weaving through them did not go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we hit the hallway and I could extend my legs it was an easy run. His ear to ear grin disappeared once I caught him, but the laughter on both sides did not. @CAPS1 @MONTH1 have got my face but I got his head! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of his first year, and they still party hard, but thanks to us no more squirt guns. I think if we would have waited any longer it would have taken some more work to get him to like school. @PERSON1 is a very smart, athletic and good child. @CAPS1 will be just fine in school, plus @CAPS1 is strong so I pity the child who fights him."	22	20		42				5	4	5	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20787	8	" I know you guys listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that alot of people don't really answer the prompt that you give them. Well I'm sorry because I was not able to answer the prompt either. I cannot remember when the last time I had a really good @CAPS3 within a couple of years, so I will tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What's so special about laughter? For me laughter helps us in many ways. I will talk about how laughter is good for my health, how everyone's laughs are different and even make us @CAPS3 at them. Also why laughter is so special to me.  I have always felt this weird feeling in my head after I laughed. I think it's because endorphins are being produced into my brain. If I @CAPS3 too hard my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works out my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @CAPS3 with people. Emotionally laughing makes me happy. Also physical is always funny when you work out with a friend.  I think that everybody's @CAPS3 is unique in it's own way. I also know that sometimes it's funny to listen to other people chuckle, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that just makes us, us!  Laughing to me is special because of all the people who make me @CAPS3. My friends are family I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because those people are special to me. Laughing with my father is nothing compared to me laughing with my mother. Laughing with my friends will never compare to me laughing with my significant other.  My life is all about laughter and it's special to me. It's not like chewing a piece of gum. It's a whole other thing. Nothing is more fun then having a girls night and laughing all night, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life.                         So @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20790	8	" Laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you've just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion @CAPS2 brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role. @CAPS2 was the @DATE1 I was fifteen and a sophomore at @ORGANIZATION1 school. @CAPS2 was my first year there. I have been to many schools, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wood, etc. and like any new school I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday I woke up, got ready, went to school, got home did homework (maybe), and went to bed . @CAPS2 was a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much. Because one thing I realized was that trying to be cool and something you're not only gets you so far. The one thing that kids, people in general, like is when you're real and being yourself . I found that out later on, but I actually didn't realize that's what people liked the most. I said to myself one time that I didn't like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was I actually thought that I was a cool person deep down. So I changed my ways I stopped trying to act cool, and acted like myself. And @CAPS2 turned out that I actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive, and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable. My main attribute, well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @CAPS2 gained me many friends that I didn't have in the beginning. @CAPS2 even gained me one of the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her name was @LOCATION2, in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, caramel skin, and the face of a goddess ( and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me. So what chance did I have? What did I, @PERSON1 have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times. Even though @CAPS2 didn't last as long as I would have liked @CAPS2( forever) @CAPS2 was great being with her for as long as I did, the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together, are priceless. And @CAPS2 was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that @CAPS2 is today. Sure, there is still crime and many horrors and atrocity's committed today, but imagine how horrid @CAPS2 would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. @CAPS2 allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
20791	8	" Laughter @MONTH1 be the best part of life. It usually expresses the feeling of happiness and joy. The expression almost seems contagious in a way, one laugh that goes hand in hand with a smile could improve someones day drastically. Possibly the best part about laughter is that it is not hard to come by, there are many things in our world that are worthy of laughter. I have personally find myself laughing most when I am around people that I enjoy being with. Some people think the key to happiness @MONTH1 be love or joy, or possibly being happy with yourself. I think the key is surrounding yourself with the ones you love and care for because everything seems better when they are around. They are comparable to sunshine, everything is better in its presence.  My favorite memory that involved excessive laughter took place on a warm @DATE1 day at my friend's house just outside of city limits. It must have been around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. The @DATE1 air was warm, but not overwhelmingly hot. It seemed like the perfect afternoon. My friends and I were hanging out, playing catch with a football, building a fire, and being happy. We had all the components needed to have the best night of our lives. The most vivid memory I have is when we were playing catch, I threw a deep pass to my friend and as he he was running under the ball, he ran straight into a fence. He got up laughing, and the laughter spread. That, you could say, set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of the @TIME1 seemed like it could have been straight out of a movie. Everything was going right and we were all feeling good. It was the quintessence of happiness. Laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us. It had to me my best memory of laughter."	20	18		38				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4

My sister is the only person i trust with my secrets. She is the only one who makes me happy when i feel down. My sister and I, laugh with eachother at our own jokes. My sister is my other half and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when i need her. I'll always be there for her also. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2, my sister and I laugh and play. One day I came off the bus from school, all i could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, the tears fell down like a river flowing. The bus appeared and a sense of joy appeared with it. @CAPS1, it wasnt the bus that brought my joy. It was my sister, right away she could feel my pain and noticed my tears. I could see in her face, the love and care. She asked me whats wrong. I could hear the worry in her voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed through my mouth. @CAPS1 need to think of what to say. I told her what happened without a pause. Afterwards, she told me something I'll never forget. She said,""@CAPS1 matter whatever happens, I'll always love you."" @CAPS2 we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh. A chorus of laughter filled the air. Nothing that people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh at it."	15	16		31				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
20793	8	" The night was dark and cloudy giving my surroundings a gloomy figure. Shadows slithered across the street by the lamp light of passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed that karma was out to get me. Everything that could go wrong; did go wrong. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that should not have been stated. Resulting in her calling me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering wreckage in our wake. Our conversation ended in fury and the disconnection of phones. Once I laid back down in my bed, and my anger diminished, I began to feel an overwhelming sense of guilt.  I said things that were unnecessary and horrible. As I laid on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing being squeezed by some unseen force. It labored my breathing and soon tears began to fall from my eyes. The guilt and agony crept through my soul like a burglar creeping through a dark house, and stealing whatever valuables I had left. My day had ended in tears and pain. But then my phone rang once more. Quickly I wiped the tears from my face and proceeded to read the caller I.D. I turned out to be my best friend, and so I answered not knowing what @CAPS1 wanted. @CAPS1 asked if I wanted to hang out and possibly catch a bite to eat. His words lifted my spirit even if it was only half an inch. When @CAPS1 pulled into my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I climbed into the passenger's seat and immediately @CAPS1 knew something was wrong. @CAPS1 asked me if something had happened and I replied with a one worded answer, ""@PERSON1.""  @CAPS1 knew that it was not the right time to talk about it, and so we drove to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I began to rip open sugar packets vigorously and dump them into my steaming cup of coffee. @CAPS1 did the same but with much less force. Then @CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded my head. I started to spill out all the events of my day in rapid succession. Bringing a storm of swearing and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice grew softer and my fists unclenched. We sat there in silence for a short time while @CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the time being because @CAPS1 saw that I was still squeezing my car keys. @CAPS1 asked how things were with my mother and another storm of curses poured from my mouth. We became silent again and then @CAPS1 asked me, ""@CAPS2 you feel better now that you got it all out?"" I looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply I expected. After thinking about it I replied yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, payed, and left. My mood had been lifted, but I was still upset. So we drove down to the river and exited his claustrophobic car. @CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there just staring at the water. @CAPS1 then asked if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The joke @CAPS1 told me probably should not be repeated but it made me laugh so hard I had trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and it made my mood soar. I have always turned to my friends when I felt down. And there have always been there proving I can count on them.  That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be far better then I had hoped. It is not only the fact that my friends can lift my mood, but it is also important that they make me laugh. Because if your counting on someone to brighten your day, what better way to @CAPS2 it ten make them laugh. Laughter has always held important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mostly because I find the most idiotic things hilarious. I know that laughter will never disappear. I hope that one day when I am old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I enjoyed a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magical. It can make a sad man glad, make sunshine on a cloudy day, and make light of the darkest situations."	20	22		42				4	4	5	5	4	4	5	4	5	5	5	4						
20794	8	"  Being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend. Everyone has their flaws; a friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust. A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. Making someone laugh can always help when they think that it's not possible for their life to get any worse. Laughter is the most valued gift that can be given. You know inside that it's making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face. There have been many times in my life where I have laughed so hard that I cried. There is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter. I laugh a lot throughout the day. When I don't, people get suspicious and they feel like there's something wrong with me. That's literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life. Laughing is my second language in life. There has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that I cried tremendously hard. My friends were staying the @TIME1 at my house and we were just being boys. We did so many things that mad us question our sanity: we at hot sauce by the spoon full, we watched comedy shows, and we also ate ourselves sick. It was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. While watching the comedy shows, we couldn't breath. We were laughing so hard! Nothing could make me stop laughing; I would just keep replaying every joke in my head and I'd start laughing even more. I already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier. The comedian was a magician with words; the way he put them all together to just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did that for ten minutes straight! It was unbelievable. Making these life-long memories with my friends is something that I will never forget. I truly know how great I have it in my life; people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support I get from my friends and family. All my experiences are the things I learn from, whether they're good or bad, I know that its all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me. All the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. They made a point in my day great as well. Being myself around them is great as well because I know that they're already accepted me into their lives and I don't have to try to be anyone else.  Everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it. I really don't even know why they would because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while? I really don't think that there is any. I feel really honored that I have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life. It shouldn't be any other way in my personal opinion. Live life to the fullest; why would you want to live it any other way?"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20795	8	" Its always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. @PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worry. Couple minutes later, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happen. @PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time. Even thought that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to @PERSON1 but I was confuse. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confuse, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON1 was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relief that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst. As I was laughing I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to be call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON1 laughed with me and thank me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and cant really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh I found out laughter was a key element of life.

Because without @CAPS3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @CAPS1 are a great source for laughter, @CAPS1 are the people you go to to be yourself. Some people use laughter for to release pain. For example, whenever @CAPS10 dad gets hurt he starts laughing. @CAPS10 @CAPS2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he got hit in the stomach. Nothing really was wrong, but @CAPS3 did hurt him. so @CAPS10 @CAPS2 sat down and started to laugh. I guess this so-called trait is hereditary because I find myself doing the exact same thing from time to time.  When I learned about how laughter heals, @CAPS3 wasn't too long ago. @CAPS3 was last @DATE3, @CAPS3 was early @DATE5 and @CAPS5 of @DATE5 was coming close. Traditionally me and @CAPS10 parents would drive to @ORGANIZATION1. And use the money we have been saving up all year round and buy a huge pack of fireworks.  Once @CAPS5 of @DATE5 came I was filled with joy, I woke up and immediately run up to @CAPS10 mom and ask ""@CAPS3's @CAPS5 of @DATE5 can I take the fireworks out to the package now?"" I was a new puppy discovering its first chew toy. @CAPS7 shook her head ""@CAPS6 yet @PERSON1, its only eleven in the morning. Sunset doesn't come around till seven or eight"" @CAPS7 smiled at me. ""@CAPS8 girl."" @CAPS7 whispered as @CAPS7 left the room.  Once the huge golden sun finally went down and the smaller bright shimmering stars appeared. We all knew @CAPS3 was time. ""@CAPS9 you like to do the honors?"" @CAPS10 dad handed me the first firework and a lighter. A big smile appeared onto @CAPS10 face without @CAPS10 control. I loved fireworks, I love bright colors watching them as they spewed into the newly lit sky, filling @CAPS3 with a sea of colorful sparks. After @CAPS5 of @DATE5 had ended @CAPS10 cousin @CAPS12 came over. @CAPS10 mom had was little sick but @CAPS3 wasn't something that was contagious. @CAPS10 @CAPS25 figured that we were old enough to take care for ourselves and for @CAPS10 mom. And @DATE3 was ending and I wanted to see the movie @CAPS13 with @CAPS10 mom and @CAPS12 so badly.  @CAPS10 mom had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. but @CAPS3 seemed like @CAPS7 got a new pill from the doctor every week because the symptoms from each pill was causing more and more problems.  Its mid @DATE5, @DATE4, and still no sign of @CAPS10 mom getting any better. @CAPS12 and I took walks with the dogs to the near by park, we went swimming, watched @CAPS15, clean the cars, We would try to find anything to do really.  @DATE1 came, and @CAPS10 mom was showing signs of improvement @CAPS7 was walking more naturally . I called @CAPS10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait one more day. I was worried about waiting another day because @CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day, I woken up by the soft whisper of @CAPS10 moms voice. ""@LOCATION1, @PERSON1 honey wake up"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder. I opened @CAPS10 eyes slowly, opening them wider as @CAPS10 eyes focused of what was around me. ""@CAPS18 go to the movies?"" @CAPS7 shook @CAPS10 shoulder once again. ""@CAPS19, but your sick."" I exhaled a heavy sigh. ""I am feeling a lot better today."" @CAPS7 smiled. ""@CAPS21 because the next showing is in twenty minutes."" The sudden rush to @CAPS21, woke me up. I then woke @CAPS12 up and we soon then left. The movie was good. Afterward, @CAPS12 went home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun went away, the whole house stood still.  @DATE2. this day is usually a time to kick back. I was on @CAPS10 computer most of the day, @CAPS10 dad was playing his video game. and @CAPS10 mom was in the kitchen preparing dinner. @CAPS10 dad went in to help her with dinner. until @CAPS7 almost had fallen with a few pans in her hands. @CAPS10 dad suggested that @CAPS7 go and take a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @CAPS10 dad had found @CAPS10 mother. laying stiff, cold...@CAPS10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day. I felt as if @CAPS10 heart had exploded like a firework. A few days have passed I stood still on the couch. I found comfort in texting @CAPS12. Told her what the doctors told us. @CAPS12 mentioned how torn @CAPS10 @CAPS25 was about @CAPS10 mom. And even though @CAPS12 was hurting inside, her and her @CAPS2 @PERSON2 tried to get @CAPS10 @CAPS25 and everyone to laugh. Because they knew that laughter would make some of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing for finding a bit of laughter in a dark place. That is why laughter is a important element of out lives. "	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3

I believe this because at one point in time my older brother and I did not get along very well. We were almost never around each other, and when we were,we would either be fighting or ignoring one another. It wasn't much of a problem since he is five years older; but once I became older my brother and I began to see one another more often. So we then decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't exactly sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes we just sat there in silence. Just two guys on the back porch in the middle of the @TIME1. Then out of no were he fell over backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we have ever laughed in our lives. So @CAPS1, when my family get together, there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit and tell stories and laugh.For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important components of a relationship because, with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life. So I say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between all people."""	15	18		33				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4						
20800	8	" This true story might sound some what cheesy, but its true and in my opinion its a love story. I will be substituting the real names with others names though. On @DATE1, after a long day at school @PERSON1 decided to log on @CAPS1-book to chat with some new friends she had made online. @PERSON1 had forgotten that she had sent a friend's request to @PERSON2. @CAPS6 @PERSON2 had accepted @PERSON1's request that's when @PERSON1 remembered about the request. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 stared to know more and more about each other minute after minute, @CAPS9 before the had no clue who the other one was. @PERSON2 gave @PERSON1 his number after along chat, @CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in contact while being off of @CAPS1-book. @PERSON2 was starting to like @PERSON1 and @CAPS12 was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 now knew that @PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @NUM1 and also have friends in common. @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked talking to @PERSON2 a lot. @CAPS12 did @PERSON2 to @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 noticed that @PERSON2 loved to laugh a lot. I mean ""a lot"", @PERSON1 @CAPS4 liked that because it always made her day. @PERSON2 knew @PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Any how, @PERSON2 didn't mind, he @CAPS4 liked @PERSON1. He had a @CAPS4 big hope that he could have a chance at making @PERSON1 happy. @CAPS12... he @CAPS5 @PERSON1 if she accepted to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt she said... ""@CAPS3 I would very much like to be your girlfriend"".  ""@CAPS4 you would?"" @CAPS5 @PERSON2.  ""@CAPS3 why wouldn't I? replied @PERSON1. ""@CAPS6 I thought that you wouldn't @CAPS9 you recently got out of a relationship"" @PERSON2 answered. Days had past they were doing perfectly until... @PERSON1 starting to receive texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect @PERSON1's relationship with @PERSON2.But the bad thing was that @PERSON1 was still in love with @PERSON3. @PERSON2 knew that for one. But that didn't stop @PERSON2 from fighting to get @LOCATION1's @CAPS7. @PERSON1 is the type of girl that doesn't like hiding anything from her boyfriend. @CAPS12 one night while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 were talking on the phone, @PERSON2 decided to ask @PERSON1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @PERSON1 was scared to answer the question but she had to be honest and said... ""@CAPS8 @PERSON2 I'll try but I'm not promising anything.""@CAPS9 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 have a @CAPS4 good communication when laughing is involved, @PERSON1 changed the subject and @CAPS5 @PERSON2 if he was willing on doing her a favor. Of course @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3"". The favor that @PERSON1 had @CAPS5 @PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. ""@CAPS11!"" @PERSON2 laughed. ""@CAPS12 can you do me that favor? @PERSON1 @CAPS5. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS11! @PERSON2 laughed again. Who would of thought that laughter in a relationship could make it @CAPS12 much better. @CAPS3 it wouldn't make it perfect or exactly how you want it to be but it's sure much better than fighting @NUM2 for things that are just plain dumb and pointless. I believe that laughter plays a excellent part in any kind of relationship. It's as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with one an other. @CAPS6 I hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays an important part in all relationships.

20802	8	"My relationship with laughter.  Well the first time I came face to face with laughter was when I met my boyfriend for the first time. Before I met him I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't stand it anymore. But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time. When that happened for the first time in almost a year I smiled I didn't smile until the day I met him. That's when my friends knew that i found someone to take care of me and love me for who I am.  Later in the relationship is where laughter came into play I was laughing all the time when I was around him and not upset all the time. That's when we started hanging out but, it took all of our friends to us to hang out. After we stated to hang out we got to know each other better then we did for the beginning when we first met. It took until freshmen year for us to start dating. That is when I found out I suppose ably dating someone else and not him I didn't believe it at first until that guy came up to me and started yelling.   He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said ""@CAPS1 are @CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over?"" with a guy @CAPS3 just met. Then he tried telling me it was over and I told him ""We were never dating in the first place!"". My friends walked up to me and saw me in tears and asked me whats wrong and tried to find me someone new. By the time @CAPS4 did I was with another guy and I'm happy with him and nothing can change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us. He is the best thing that has ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when I'm upset or mad he says ""don't worry everything will be okay I promise so just believe in me.""  Laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now so we don't plan to change that unless one of us messes up again we have messed up so many time that we don't know what to do anymore. If it leaves now I don't know what I'm going to do it's apart of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together with out messing up this time around. This part of my relationship is the best and it wont change at least I hope that it wont because it would make me go back to living in fear of my step dad I'm glade that I found someone. I hope that it doesn't change because laughter is what comes with him and when I'm around him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when I was crying not even my friends and family. Now that laughter is here almost all the time I can't wait until the day that sorrow goes out the window. So now that me and him are together and happy and hopefully nothing goes bad between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not my bubbly self when he's not around. Six to @CAPS2 of my friends say "" @CAPS3 are losing your bubbly self don't let her disappear on @CAPS3 she is there to guide @CAPS3 down the road."" @CAPS4 also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason @CAPS1 I don't is because @CAPS4 can be bossy and @CAPS4 tell me what I can and can't do. @CAPS1 can't people just understand that this relationship isn't going to work if @CAPS4 keep getting in the middle of it @CAPS4 all think that my life revolves around them and it doesn't. My relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family it has to do with my boyfriend and me and that's @CAPS1 I told @CAPS3 about my relationship with laughter. Lets just say my relationship with laughter will always be here and nothing will change it not even my parents or his parents we can promise @CAPS3 that much. @CAPS1 can't this relationship just have a happy ending to it with out anyone or anything trying to get in the middle of it? I just wish that there was a world @CAPS3 could just run away to with out anyone knowing where it's at in the world. Well just to say nothing can make this relationship ever go bad unless we start to fight again with each other I hope that nothing will tear us apart and if it does who knows what will happen."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20803	8	"                             ""Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life."	20	17		37				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20804	8	"Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. With out laughter my life wouldn't be as wonderful as it is right now. I have many people in my life that make laughter the best way to brighten up my day, like my friends, family, and boyfriend. I have many stories in which laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache.    It all happened on a @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 I was heading home from my boyfriends house. We were sitting on the max and my stomach started to hurt. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me that it's probably because I haven't ate anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip to my house my boyfriend was trying to distract me so I wouldn't worrying so much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me how my day was at school and I told him that my day was okay, not bad.     We started talking for awhile, up until my boyfriend took off his hat and said ''from flat to volume!'' @CAPS1 my boyfriend took off his hat and said that I bursted out laughing! I was laughing so hard that instead of my stomach hurting because I didn't eat all day, it was hurting because of how hard and how much I was laughing. I was laughing so hard because my boyfriends hair was all messed up. His hair looked so funny! As I was trying not to laugh I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like that? He started telling me that @CAPS1 he was taking a shower he had grabbed a shampoo bottle that said from flat to volume and he didn't know that his hair was going to have so much volume.The whole way home I couldn't stop laughing about my boyfriends hair. I thought it was so funny, that I had forgotten about my stomach ache.     Till this day I still laugh about my boyfriends hair and how it looked that day. We now have an inside joke and every time I remember that day I tell him ''from flat to volume'' and we both just start laughing.Now i know thatlaughter is the best medicine for me @CAPS1 I have a stomach ache. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!"	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20805	8	" Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends even became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you have and couldn't remember. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @PERSON3 and I became friends. I'm also going to tell you how we have stayed friends for as long as we have and all the little things that have kept us friends. Admittedly we did not start off as friends who laughed all the time, instead we started off as a crier and a helper.  @PERSON3 and I first met in the eighth grade. I had just gotten called out of my first period class and greeted by my math teacher @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told me that we had just gotten a new student that moved here from @LOCATION1 and wasn't exactly happy about it. She also asked me if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @PERSON4, I agreed and walked into the room @PERSON3 was in. When I saw her the first thing I noticed was her eyes, as the tears went down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who, like @PERSON1 said wasn't happy. I will admit i was a little scared to try and show her around seeing as she wasn't happy at all to be here. But once we got started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wouldn't even crack a smile at our feeble tempts to make jokes. I still felt like she should be happy and broke out the big guns. So I walked differently and talked in a funny voice, I even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Eventually she smiled, so I kept going. Toward the end I got her and @PERSON4 to laugh so hard we all almost wet ourselves. But as funny as it was for us, it definitely wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the type of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see that person it happened with, right? Well to say the least @PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this one time in our drawing and painting class we, @PERSON3, @LOCATION2, and @CAPS1 and I, were all in @PERSON2's little office getting a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and so had @CAPS3 else. I randomly look around the room and see a really cute looking poster I hadn't noticed ever before and without realizing it I had said aloud, ""@CAPS2, that's really cute."" @CAPS3 started laughing and holding on to the desk to keep from falling to the ground. I still hadn't realized I said it aloud and was really confused but still laughing because watching them laugh was really entertaining. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I'd just said and I blushed but started laughing along. Now every time they see me and remember that moment they crack up laughing and they point to something and say it the way I said it. That's why I think that having the big memories of the really funny thing has kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our link strong throughout the group of our friends.  But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we didn't do all the little funny things and only did either big funny things, or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we're talking and we accidentally burp or we fart while we walk. Or maybe when I laugh and I hide my face with my hands and my arms jiggle. Possibly even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with that other person, I feel like I become a better person and I believe I help her become one too. Besides the little things are just as funny as the big things we do.  So as I've stated before laughter is a big part of a friendship. @PERSON3 and my friendship hadn't started in of laughter, it started in tears and grew to be laughter. Laughter had brought us together in an act of weirdness and it has stayed very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank we don't really even have that much in common, it is because of the big hilarious moments we've shared not only together, but with other people and the little things we do on a daily basis that we find really funny. I do have to say laughter is probably the best thing to keep any relationship good and healthy."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20806	8	" There are a couple things that can lead strangers to being comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriends parents was very nerve wrecking and uncomfortable. I am a people person and I can get along with anybody. Starting a conversation with someone who is judging my every move was a little bit of a challenge.  My boyfriend @PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people that like spending time with our families. So because of this it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we attended the last years of elementary and some of middle school and all but one year of high school together, I left for a couple years and came back really different. So after @NUM1 months of dating I met the folks.  One day in @DATE1 @PERSON3 had a football game that i attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys on the team. After a terrible loss @PERSON3 came out of the locker room and hugged me and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with it, but the fact that I wanted his parents to love me put a lot of weight on me.  I slowly walked over after him, and said ""@CAPS3"" in my most friendly voice possible. His mother reached out and said "" @CAPS1 @PERSON1, I'm @CAPS2"" I took her hand and shook it and replied ""@CAPS3, so nice to meet you"". I looked at @ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance then his father reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "" @CAPS4 there, I'm @PERSON2"", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a bit comfortable. "" @CAPS1 , great to meet you, what did you think of the game?'. He looked surprise that i talked and we started a great conversation about football.  After talking about football for about @NUM2 or @NUM3 minutes @PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling it to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke, @PERSON3 thought it was lame, yet i loved it. I took the chance anyways. I said "" @CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke"", @PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that said oh god, don't. I looked away and started ""so there were two muffins in the oven one said, wow its hot in here, there the other screamed, holy crap! A talking muffin. I started laughing and my laugh is very odd. Anyone i meet tells me me laugh is so unique. His mother was like ""that is adorable i will have to tell it to @CAPS6"", I smiled gratefully. His father @PERSON2 said so sweetly "" I like your laugh, i ain't heard anything like it"". @PERSON3 came in and said ""yes her laugh is really something"". We all kinda smiled and at each other and went to dinner, cracking jokes and laughing then laughing at my laugh. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcomed. Until this day we laugh at me telling that joke. I still until this day am happy i told the joke."	17	18		35				3	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20807	8	"   On @DATE1, I had a mission trip meeting in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 at @NUM1 o'clock in the @TIME1. @CAPS11 friend @PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I had @CAPS11 grandpa pick us up from the house and take us to @LOCATION2. When we got to the church I went to @CAPS11 meeting till @NUM2 o'clock, then went to bible study. I was tired and ready to go home by then.    Come to realize @CAPS11 grandpa is know where to be found, he apperently left to go home and @CAPS11 mom, grandma and @CAPS11 sister @CAPS3 had just got there to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for the students going on the mission trip. After the meeting we went to @PERSON1 craft store. When we got there me and @PERSON2 went over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, while @CAPS11 mom, grandma, and @CAPS3 stayed in @LOCATION3. I bought me and @CAPS11 mom a pair of comfortable slippers. then we went back into @PERSON1 to brag about the slippers to @CAPS11 mom and grandma.   That was a bad idea, @CAPS11 grandma decided she needed a pair for herself, so she walked over to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She was taking forever. I told her that if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @CAPS6, get a sandwhich, and come back. So we did. When we got to @CAPS6 @PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home.   We ordered our sandwhichs and went back to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She finally found herself a pair of slippers, after looking for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think were going home when all of a sudden grandma shouts out ""were going to @LOCATION5's, I want a bowl of chili"". Our reaction was ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11 gosh"". We couldn't let her be hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says ""I need to go into @ORGANIZATION1"", @CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in @ORGANIZATION1 forever in a day.   After we got back in the car from @ORGANIZATION1 I sat in the backseat in the middle of @CAPS3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I told @PERSON2 not to forget to show @CAPS11 mom an important piece of mail he had when we got home, and his response was ""@CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home"". All I could do was laugh. I was being video taped by @PERSON2 and @CAPS11 mom kept looking back at me to see if I was ok. I just couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so hard I was crying, I lost all @CAPS11 breath, and @CAPS11 face was as red as a cherry. I laughed without a break from @ORGANIZATION1 to @LOCATION4 road. When I eventually fell asleep."	18	17		35				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	4						
20808	8	" Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughing is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my realationship with my sister @LOCATION1, we laugh all day, everyday. And I think thats why we have most fun together. I laugh most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with @PERSON2 and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. I'm just a laughing person. Everybody knows that. I think when I laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. I have this one friend namd @PERSON3, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time me and @PERSON2 were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. Then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. See, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. Who cares. Be you. I love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. In movies and tv shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  One time me and my sister @PERSON2 stole a truck, well.. We asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. It was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. So, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. It's funny to just sit there and reminise. I could tell you a thousand stories. Heres one. One time, me and @PERSON2 were living with our good friend @PERSON1, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! I'll never forget that time. And even when I'm writing this I still laugh about these stories. One time me and my sister @PERSON2 were skating downtown, and I was trying to do this one trick, I think it was a tre' flip? Anyways, I tryed to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory that I have, I laugh when remebered. One time me and @PERSON2 were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. That was really funny. In the video I'm mostly just laughing. "	15	16		31				3	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
20809	8	"@CAPS1.., that is a sound i love to hear, laughter. Laughter plays a big roll in my life. To me it is the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it is even better then ice cream, and that is saying a lot. I have had many different experiences in life that laughter has been a big part of. Like @CAPS6 my brother got sent back to jail. @CAPS6 I was @CAPS5 I had to laugh because it was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Also, @CAPS6 i got dumped like last nights garbage, laughter made me feel as if nothing had ever happened. So @CAPS6 people are not feeling the best or are going through struggles in their life, I truly believe that laughter will make everything feel a little bit better. "@CAPS2!", it hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother got put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just gotten out from a four month sentence, three months ago. One of the hardest things is thinking of what to say @CAPS6 his three year old son, @PERSON1, asks "@CAPS3's @CAPS4?". The main reason I'm not as scared for my brother as I was is because of my nephew @PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So whenever my brother gets thrown back into jail, I know everything will be okay @CAPS6 I see a big smile on @PERSON1's little chubby face. He is my inspiration to smile @CAPS6 I feel like there is absolutely nothing in this word to smile or laugh about. Even @CAPS6 we were both sitting in the emergency room he still just kept on laughing.  Being @CAPS5 is the absolute worst thing in the world to me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go places. All I usually do is go stuff outside with my friends, but @CAPS6 I'm @CAPS5 I cant do anything. The only things I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pains. Then not even two weeks later I was back in the emergency room with strep. I was in a lot of pain for about four weeks all together. one thing I hate more then being @CAPS5, is people feeling bad for me being @CAPS5. So whenever I'm @CAPS5 I always crack jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts me to laugh. Even though the laughing did not feel good physically, it sure made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughing is like my brand of medicine for @CAPS6 I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster then any other over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first "love". "I just don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore", that was the last thing he said to me. My first "love" just left me standing alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real break-up. I was having a pretty hard time dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up my friends came and picked me up. They told me that I needed to be cheered up. @CAPS6 we got into town we stopped by the store. My friend @PERSON3 told me to pick out a half gallon of ice-cream, so I got mint chocolate chip. We finally got to @PERSON3's house and he told me that I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream to myself. Of course I didn't argue. While I was eating the ice cream him and my friend @PERSON2 put on a little skit of how they were going to be up my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard I got a brain freeze. By the time the skit was over I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughing made me forget that I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex we never hung out because i was always with him. I had a blast that day and I will remember it forever. Laughing is truly the key to living a great life. "@CAPS6 life gives you lemons make lemonade", that is a quote that I chose to listen to and try to follow. To me the quote is just saying to enjoy the little things in life. So whenever I laugh, I am enjoying a little pleasures in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how hard life @MONTH1 seem. So even if my brother is in jail, I'm @CAPS5, or i just got dumped; I laugh so that I don't have to worry anymore. Laughter is a main ingredient to everyone's life, don't forget it or life wont turn out the way that anyone would want it.   "	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20812	8	" Laughter. We all need it. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder that @CAPS7 is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. We need it @CAPS8 a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. And, in my opinion, most importantly, @CAPS8 a reminder that even though we @MONTH1 make mistakes, @CAPS7 is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   In the @DATE1, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. The children, of course, were not invited. We were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, @CAPS8 @CAPS7 was nothing to do. One of my best friends, @PERSON2, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five in the @TIME1, and I was to be back no later then nine. I had four hours, and it was two weeks before @CAPS1. Neither of us knew @CAPS13 to do with so much time on our hands. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This way new to both of us. We were both sophomores, and I had a crush on @LOCATION1. This turned out to be a big problem, considering @CAPS6 knew this piece of information. @CAPS6 didn't have a problem with it, but @PERSON1, her boyfriend, did. We got along, but he didn't like the fact that I was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't @CAPS7. He trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   We had decided to set up the @CAPS1 tree first, and go from @CAPS7. We both had @CAPS3, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. Tinsels, ornaments, pictures, @CAPS14 name it. It took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It looked magnificent when we were done. I'd help make some pretty @CAPS12 looking trees, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @PERSON2 got on the @CAPS4 to talk to @PERSON1 for a bit, while texted my girlfriend. I was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   @PERSON3 and I had been together for most of my sophomore year, and I was beginning to regret it. Our relationship had started when one of my buddies, @PERSON4, and hers ended. I know this sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I was putting myself between @PERSON4 and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @CAPS6 was like a bad drug that got @CAPS14 really high, and then dropped @CAPS14 like a rock. @CAPS6 was extremely controlling. @CAPS6 wasn't @CAPS12 for me, and @PERSON2 had finally convinced me that enough was enough. After I broke up with @PERSON3, I felt both happy, and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so alone. I'd never been @CAPS12 at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   Seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with @PERSON2. @CAPS6 knew me much better then most people, so @CAPS6 knew that I needed help quick. @CAPS6 did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @CAPS6 took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think it was a @CAPS12 idea. Her boyfriend was very protective of @PERSON2. He didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.   ""@CAPS5 @CAPS14 please just try to relax for a minute? Your making me nervous."" @CAPS6 said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question. Maybe it was the fact that I was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. I started laughing really hard.   ""@CAPS7. That wasn't so hard, was it?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS6 pulled away from the embrace, I kissed forehead; our way of saying ""your beautiful.""   ""@CAPS9 @CAPS14 going to be okay?"" @CAPS6 asked in a worried voice.   ""@CAPS11, I'll be fine. Thanks @PERSON2.""   ""@CAPS12. @CAPS14 never showed me that guitar thing.""   ""@CAPS13 guitar thing?""   ""@CAPS14 said @CAPS14 played guitar."" @CAPS15 then I realized that I might not ever get another friend @CAPS8 @CAPS12 @CAPS8 this one.   ""@CAPS16 @CAPS11. Come on. I'll show @CAPS14 how to play @CAPS17 man."""	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20813	8	" As people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. For normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. Since I was young I've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. I believe I am like this because my parents have always told me, ""People that are happy are the ones people want to be."" @CAPS1 by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends I have. Although I have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  When ever I'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. We could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. We could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. It @MONTH1 be starting an argument that is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. Most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. With all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. Stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. Stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. I have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. When someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time I will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. They need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20814	8	" Laughter is a mystery. Happens @CAPS2 ever it pleases. It puts smiles on faces. Laughter just happens in many ways it can. Although, mine just happened to end up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to follow it. Things got extream, unforgettable. Things you could never forget.  Around two months ago, in the cold @DATE1. It was my @NUM1 birthday. I threw a little party for myself at my house. Though, I was in for a little treat. @CAPS2 everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. Nobody would tell me whats going on. I started to become distraught about it all. Until my buddie @PERSON3 and my boyfriend @PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a @NUM1 pound bucket full of spaghetti, with a ten pound gallon can of tomato sauce. Next thing I knew my mouth was agape. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much of it. Also, why did they have it. My mother walked out and exclaimed ""@CAPS1 up the cars, and let's go!"" @CAPS2 we approached the @ORGANIZATION1, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my gut. I looked around and noticed my sister in law was holding a video camera. Right then and there I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extream and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, getting in peoples hair, faces. Clothes were getting stained and messy. Not to mention it was cold,wet and rainy outside. The fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the noodle war, I looked the worse. Even now the shoes i was wearing are stained. @CAPS2 we got back to my house we had to wash down with the hose. I swore i was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling outta my hair and clothing, the sauce steaming down my face. Laughing here and laughing there. Everyone was laughing at others for how badly they were covered with noodles and sauce. Eventually, we all got hungry. We decided on nachos. So, my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @MONTH1 think the noodle and sauce was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @CAPS3 dropped nachos on my couch. @PERSON3 threw nacho cheese at @LOCATION1, she threw chips at @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON3 tossed cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese fest. I couldn't believe that nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs fer and in all the girls hair. Chip crumbs were in the couch and cheese was on the floor and @CAPS4 tree. So @PERSON3 finally said""@CAPS5 more nachos!""  @CAPS6 on it was cake time. Ginger thought that there wasn't going to be another mess. Well once again she was wrong. They all started singing the happy birthday song, cameras were flashing, my mother in the background crying. She cries on our birthdays because she says its just a year closer to her kids moving out. I figured she would be use to it knowing that she already had two kids move out. All of a sudden there was frosting on my face! I rubbed the frosting off and smeared it on @PERSON1 face. Though he just rubbed it back onto mine. My mom grabbed a plate and threw it at @LOCATION2, she tossed it at @CAPS3 then @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON3 then @PERSON2. Chocolate frosting was everywhere along with nacho cheese. Soon after that we played video games. Of course me being me I played @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @NUM3 live on @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I got irritated with someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller at my television and broke it. Mother wasn't to pleased with me after that. Oh well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started leaving. Saying our goodbyes, ill see you @CAPS6, peace out dude. We said it all. I looked back in the living room and say nothing but huge mess of chips, nacho cheese, and cake. Not to mention my broken t.v. I got stuck cleaning the mess for over three hours. Though, we were laughing the entire time it happened. Having the greatest time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it all over again just for the fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @MONTH1 not see it right away. Though you will @CAPS2 you started laughing your brains out. Laughing puts everyone in good moods and smiles on there faces. It @MONTH1 also make a mess and put things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after them crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the greatest thing in this world we call @LOCATION3."	17	15		32				4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20815	8	"                              Laughter                               @PERSON1   Laughter has many benefits that make us have might make us have more distance in between two people or maybe make us have differenceses in between the relationships you have with people. But many other people believe and (think) that laughter is an important part of any relationship with your friends, family ect. Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit to us, and how it can also make us have distances from people, or how laughter works in between relashionships we have with friends. Many people think that it's really fun to laugh about simple things and thats me I can laugh for things that might not seem funning to others, but to me they might seem extremely funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But many other poeple don't consider laughter as funny, as many others. I believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express your self on things. Many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes. Thats the reason why I think it's a great idea or (thing) to do around, just have some fun and laugh. Now talking about relashionship in between people. Do you think that laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how could it help us (ways)????? Well yes I do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationship we have with people. You get to know and others get to know about you and how you are.  Eventhough many relationships that we have with our friends, family, or with new people we meet. I believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses how that person is and wheither they are fun people to be around. Laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or doesn't have any humor at all. When people don't have that much humor they really don't understand and get the funny parts from jokes or anything. I also think that laughter is really important to any type of relationship you have with anybody, because that makes you know that person a lot better. But other people consider laughter being a reason that distances two people from each other.I don't considerlaughter being a reason for to people to have distances in between. The reasons why I think and say this is becasue their are many people that laugh a lot almost crying and they don't have distances in between other people or anything. They might get more friends or more people to talk to them becasue other people as well might see how that person is and they might see that the person is really fun to be around with. I know this becasue I laugh a lot and that hasn't happened to me. Thats why I don't consider and don't believe that laughter is being the reason to have distances in between people (relationship). In my opinion I consider laughter a very important part of who we are, the way we think, and also the things we like to do. What I mean by this is that you can have some humor but you don't actually express the way you are thinking about what other do. Or if something is super silly and theirs a new kid at school and you or someone else says something you might probably think that it's funny but you might just not want to laugh at that moment becasue you @MONTH1 a little to shy or simply becasuue you might not know that person as well and maybe the other person won't have enough confidence to laugh with you for whatever silly thing someone just said. Although many people still should laugh whenever they want. Sometimes if you laugh a lot you might be the happiest and funniest person anywhere. Or whenever somebody is sad you might as well be the only person theri who can make her/him laugh and happy. In addition these were some of the reasons why i think that laughter is great for you, that way people will get to know you better. These were a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit,how it can distance people."	15	16		31				3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3						
20817	8	"          There are times I get along with others and times I don't. There also are times where I make others laugh until they cry. Like this one time me and my friends where walking to the store, I start pointing out the most random things. When I pointed out the @CAPS1 store, he started laughing so hard that he literally peed his pants. So we had to go back to his house so he could change into some clean cloth, and it took him @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @CAPS6 he was doing in there, and he said. ""I'm taking a pee."" @CAPS2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when it hit me why he was laughing so hard about me pointing out the @CAPS1 store. It was because the last time we had gone inside and there was a man talking about his son's football team which my friend and I was on at the time, was in the top ten. Guss @CAPS6 we really weren't. The man felt so afraid of @CAPS6 the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @CAPS5 gets up and says to us. ""@CAPS4 you for letting me know that. I thought he was right for a second."" @CAPS5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. ""@CAPS6 about me? How come I don't get a hug."" That when I started to laugh harder @CAPS2 heck. Good thing I did not have to go to the rest room. "	13	17	30	30				2	2	2	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3
20818	8	"@CAPS4 fills the air around us with happiness and joy, @CAPS4 brings warm memory's of loved ones that are close to us , and adds a splash of hope to those who need @CAPS4. Laughter is the key to solving life's problems.@CAPS4 is a way of adding something special into our life and comes from many different areas of life .Laughter could come from a pitiful joke that someone could have told you,@CAPS4 could be brought up by a show, and @CAPS4 could also come from the joy we get when a near loved one has returning home from a long journey. Imagine seeing something comical like a person falling down or crashing into a pole , the moment right when that happens you hear your self laughing as hard as you can that you practically cant breath and the person standing right next to you is joining in on the laugh. Although @CAPS3 might seem rude and disrespectful you have just made a bond with the person right next to you and found a similarity between the both of you. @CAPS3 is how friendships are brought up and made, just by one little thing that made you both laugh and have a connection with each other can trigger a brand new friendship between to people that could either last a minute or can last a life time. In my case @CAPS3 is how I met one of my closest friend ever , we had seen a student from our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the flag pole and replace the @ORGANIZATION1 state flag with his own personal home made flag ( he got the @CAPS1 off of a show ) ,as he was heading up the pole almost half way their he must have gotten scared because minutes later he started yelling for help, a minute later the faculty members finally heard his cry's and yells and tried to get him down from ware he was, @CAPS4 took them almost half an hour to get him down. @CAPS3 was the moment ware I had made one of the greatest friendship I've ever had in my life. Many friendships are made in class and with the people you go to work with but a great friendship is brought up by a simple laugh two people share with each other. God laugh's last. @CAPS3 is the name of @PERSON1 son of @CAPS2 and @PERSON2. In @CAPS3 story @PERSON2 the @CAPS5 of @PERSON1 claimed that she was surprised when she was blessed with her only child and that people would laugh and be surprised the same way she was when they hear the news. Being surprised or shocked can also bring some one to laugh at what either happened in their surroundings or what they did them self's. I remembered a time ware I laughed at something that took me by surprise, @CAPS4 was when my @CAPS5 lost the keys to the house inside the car, we looked for them every ware but had no luck finding them, after an hour had pass we called my dad so he would bring the other key to the house, after we called him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get their but as soon as my father parked in the driveway my @CAPS5 found the key that she lost inside her pocket (@CAPS4 was a typical cartoon moment).When we heard the news we all just started laughing at what has just happen, we were all shocked and a little dumbfounded when that happened. As you can see being surprise can also bring a smile and a laugh onto someones face. Picture yourself staring into the eyes of some one close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out the slightest bit of a giggle or a smile and then find yourself laughing nonstop for no reason. That is basically an every day thing for me and my sister. My sister and I can't stare at each other for even a minute, we eventually start laughing the first five seconds and end up laughing a hole hour without stop, but as soon as we stop laughing we note's that we were laughing for no apparent reason , which would make us laugh for another hour more.That the kind of laughter that two people that are so close to each other get , the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh but you end up laughing for no reason at all.@CAPS3 shows the connection two people have with each other the type ware you know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memory's of family gatherings for the holidays , friendships we made when we were in school , memory's of our childhood and how thing we thought then were in style and cool are k now thing we look back into and laugh at, by being a little surprise, and can also be The fact that we know someone by heart ."	16	16		32				3	4	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	3	3	3						
20819	8	" LaughterI laugh everyday. I feel a lot of different emotions when I am laughing. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to let my emotions be seen. when I laugh I usually feel happy after wards en less I am crying because I am hurt. When I am sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I am feeling because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I am playing the sad card to get attention. But laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better. When I am sad i tend to rely on laughter to get me threw my day because if i didn't have laughter i would have people asking what was wrong all day and it would drive me crazy. When I am angry the only way I can laugh is if a friends or family member is trying to make me happy or if I am reminiscing of fun times iv had. It makes me happy when I laugh and brightens my day when I am anger. I also laugh at things people say to me even tho they hurt my feelings when they said it, because I don't want them to know they hurt me. When I am happy all I do is smile and laugh. Laughter brightens my life when its a happy laugh.My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty silly at times and all we can do is laugh, have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew my family and friends. All those things I was just talking about come into my mind when I think of laughter. I think that every single person needs some laughter in there life to be happy.  "	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20821	8	"Laughter's @CAPS1 Laughter is everywhere. It @MONTH1 be three doors down reclining in a comfy living room. It @MONTH1 be at the nearest playground bouncing on the teeter-totter. It @MONTH1 be at an elegant restaurant sitting at a petite table in the distant corner. For me, it lingered in an old fifth grade classroom. I stumbled through the doorway carrying @CAPS11 purple backpack and @CAPS11 lunch pale resting in @CAPS11 left hand. I recognized everyone from @CAPS11 previous years of elementary school, and shortly joined them after visiting @CAPS11 hook outside the door. I had been waiting anxiously for @CAPS11 turn at the fifth grade. The legendary @PERSON1, was known as the ""coolest"" teacher around. He played a large role in the gossip of the young students, and each of us had our hopes set high. ""@CAPS2 your seats @NUM1 graders!"" announced @PERSON1 @CAPS3 with a contagious smile. Kids scattered around to room searching for seats near their closest friends. Everyone listened attentively to @PERSON1's introduction to the year. His voice caught our full attention, but not too exciting compared to our expectations. He appeared very nice as most teachers come, but still nothing spectacular. The day dragged on. The sleepy faces returned and the vivid colors had escaped our touch. The day finally reached an end, not satisfying the eager children. The next day rose quickly and I trudged back to the disappointing classroom. To @CAPS11 surprise, the next day was nothing like the first. The classroom @CAPS7 experienced a drastic change. Every wall was filled with endless color. Posters layered over the plain paint with fascinating pictures and words. A fancy popcorn machine rested in the back of the room. Fresh popcorn overflowed from inside. The smell traveled through our needy nostrils as we entered. Mr. @CAPS3 sat contently at his broad desk as we made our way to our seats once again. He welcomed us to our second day. After the first couple minutes of class I had found that the rumors were true. He had a sense of simple humor that created giggles in every corner of the class. His ideas and word choice related to us as @NUM1 graders. We found his subtle jokes quite amusing to our young minds. He spoke like we spoke, he acted like we acted, and he joked like we joked. He even created customized nicknames for each of us. Laughter hung over our heads like a heavy @CAPS1, never continuing along. Weekly popcorn servers would hand out stuffed bags to all the kids as the class read aloud. Kids became ecstatic on jeopardy @CAPS4 gathering teams as quick as possible. His classroom became a place that we wanted to stay forever, never parting from hour long games and water chugging contests. Despite the everlasting fun and games, @PERSON1 showed us what it was really like to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to strive in every moment of life. He taught us to write with desire and worth. To express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story that we want heard. He would plan one on one time with students struggling in a particular subject, and next class their confidence had bloomed. He had an ability to reach into our minds, find out who we were, and emerge that hidden confidence to become @CAPS9. We respected him, yet felt comfortable messing around with him during class as he had frequently done to us. @PERSON1 gave us a craving to learn.  @DATE1 @TIME1, I had began to walk home, when @PERSON1 @CAPS3 stopped me at the door.  ""@CAPS6 @PERSON2C!"" I unexpectedly said in a high tone, not hiding @CAPS11 enthusiasm. He chuckled, ""@CAPS7 fun at class today?"" ""@CAPS8 yeah,"" I answered with a grin. ""I'm glad"" he continued, then changing the subject, ""I was thinking about having a huge dodge ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Do @CAPS10 think that would be a good idea?"" I snickered to myself, trying to comprehend the fact that an adult had said this to me, ""That would be so fun."" ""@CAPS9,"" he expressed quite excited, ""@CAPS10 are a really neat kid, @CAPS10 know that? Its a lot of fun having @CAPS10 in class."" @CAPS11 face lit up. I stood there smiling for quite some time. We finished our slight conversation and I continued home. Every student in the class yearned to be liked by @PERSON1, as if he were the most popular kid at school. I was liked by @PERSON2 I was liked by the man that changed @CAPS11 whole outlook on education and life. Gradually, from time to time, I drift back to the careless days of @NUM1 grade and @PERSON2 I still laugh at the ridiculous events that occurred in that small classroom each and every day. Frequently, I glance above me to witness that dense @CAPS1 that still hovers above me. Laughter has left a mark on me, and those kids of @CAPS11 @NUM1 grade class.

20822	8	" Laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others. It lightens the mood of any situation and can really lift my sprits when I'm having a bad day. It is often the ice breaker when I meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends I already have.  On the first day of school, freshman year, I met a girl named @LOCATION1. We were in writing class and there was a boy named @CAPS1 sitting between us. @CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedules, and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomforatable. I looked up and saw that @LOCATION1 had heard what he had said and had a look on her face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and close to laughing. I smiled at her and mouthed the word ""awkward"" when @CAPS1 turned away. This was her cue that it was okay to laugh, and she did so subtly. I didn't know that this first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly. After the first week of schedules being changed and students being shuffled around, we found out that we had every single one of our classes together, except @CAPS3. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done, and I'm not exactly sure how we managed to pass all our classes. Spending so much time together, it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill up a dictionary. Nearly any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can send us into a fit of laughter. Sometimes, we don't have to say anything at all. I'll just look at her, and we'll burst out laughing. Because of this, our friends often question our sanity. When we start laughing, they'll look at eachother, and then at us for a clue as to why, or ask if we are okay. They don't understand us the way we understand eachother. People always get our names mixed up even though we look nothing alike. Our names dont even rhyme, or start with the same letter. But I can't really blame them. We're so much alike! From the activities we participate in to the way we think, we could almost be the same person. She makes me laugh every single day, and she's one of my best friends. @CAPS4 is another one of my friends who is constantly making me crack up. Whenever I'm with her, I'm always terrified of peeing in my pants. She's not as close to me as @LOCATION1 is, but we've gotten to be such better friends this year. We have a lot of classes together this year, and that's probably why we've gotten closer. We're always doing stupid stuff together, and laughing about it the whole time. For example, she and I like to laugh obnoxiously loud and exaggerate our ""ha's"" when someone tells a really lame or cheesy joke. Our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes, so when we're in his class, we sit together anticipating one of his jokes so that we can laugh. We also like to chew our gum with our mouths open, in order to make the chewing noise louder. I often laugh so hard that I can't even chew. I know I'll have a good day if I'm with @CAPS4. She can make me laugh in a way a lot of my other friends can't. It comes deep from within, to the point where you can't even breathe, and tears and running down your face. It makes your entire face is sore, even your eyes, from being scrunched up for so long. She's such a fun person to be around, and I'm glad to have her as one of my friends. Laughing is a very important part in the relationships I have with other people. If my friends couldn't make me laugh, our friendship would be so much more boring. Nothing would be fun. If I never laughed, I'd never be happy, and that's not a life I'm willing to try. Life is hard. It's not easy, and it's not always going to be smiles and smooth sailing. There's going to be sadness and rough waters. But no matter how tough this life @MONTH1 get, I know I'll have friends like @LOCATION1 and @CAPS4 there to share a laugh."	25	20		45				5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20823	8	" Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of every kind together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can bring discomfort to you and others around you, such as beans. Laughter is a medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak @CAPS2 ""language"" with a foreign friend, even when you know not an ounce of their native tongue. Laughter differs, ranging in loudness, pattern, softness, and attitude. You laughed weeks into @CAPS2 world and you'll be laughing your way out of it as well. Sometimes in life, it is important to laugh! Laughter is forgiving and a nod to acceptance. It was my freshman year and I had arrived early that morning to keep my friend company who's mom had dropped her off at such an early time, due to transportation conflicts. I wasn't sure why we were even fighting or why we were on @CAPS2 particular subject; I only knew we had gone off on a ""bunny trail"" and @CAPS4 was picking me apart for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices were escalating and despite the fact our disagreement wasn't taking a turn toward the physical, our words were just as devastating, taking jabs below the belt and giving ""black eyes"" of sorts to both teams. @CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @CAPS4 really have to carry such an air of self-righteousness? I thought, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS4 hadn't done what @CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to spill."" @CAPS2 was also wrong of me, but my attention wasn't focusing on that, but rather on deflecting her fiery words, sure to not let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that.  ""That only happenedone time!""@CAPS4 declared as @CAPS4 tried to defended herself. ""@CAPS3 way, you didn't have to tell the whole world!"" ""I didn't tell the world,"" I objected. ""I only told one person...who told one person, who told another person...and so on.""@CAPS4 raised her eyebrow in a manner as @CAPS1 to say, ""@CAPS5? You @CAPS6 know what I'm talking about."" The air in the room was as stiff as our direction we were taking in our argument, going no where and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @CAPS4 leaned back casually against the wall, attempting to appear apathetic, when her ankle succumbed to gravity and the present moisture, grazing the surface and causing her to loose her footing. All the cool @CAPS4 once had was thrown out the window. Her shoe caught the slick surface of the tile, wet from where hundreds of trodden footsteps were left from that morning's downpour. Crashing down, @CAPS4 met the unforgiving, stone floor with a @CAPS7! which left her face dazed and pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone--with her standing not three feet tall and me towering above her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that was lurking behind my dimples, I slowly slid down the wall that stood behind me, coming to eye level with her. I took one look into her eyes, as @CAPS1 they were waving a white flag and then the smug victory left me. I craned my neck backward, smiled at the ceiling and let out a giggle. I'm not sure what @CAPS4 thought about that at first yet slowly but surely, @CAPS4 managed a chuckle. My giggle triggered into a full-out laughter seizure, her catching on and soon leaving us both laying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that bleak, speckled tile, but it was that desolate stone we ended up sprawled on, heads huddled on and hands on our bellies, trying to steady our breaths back into normalcy that one early morning. Sure, I apologized and @CAPS4 accepted, but I think her forgiveness went without saying; laughter is not dependent on words. ""@CAPS8,"" @CAPS4 managed with a smile. The laughter my friend and I had shared in that pre-school classroom carried throughout the day.  ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" That very distance brought assurance into the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how silly and meaningless our petty arguments amounted to be, definitely something worth laughing at. Sure, her fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender from my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of a laugh from both sides that ended it all. So, no, while we were not on the same brave wave, our laughter was above picking sides--we were still speaking the same ""language."""	21	20		41				5	4	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20824	8	"The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter, one of the best feelings an individual can achieve. When you're feeling sad, angry, or in an argument, laughing can turn any negative feelings into good ones. Though you @MONTH1 not want to show the turn of emotion, it is very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it be a chuckle or a hilarious outburst, it completely changes one's mood. Laughing with someone is even better still. Having laughter-filled relationships is an important element to someone's well being. Sharing a @CAPS3 is a great way to start friendships and keep them thriving. Relationships without laughter soon end. It is almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exposed in relationships often. Without it, there is no connection, joy, or excitement. There is no common ground if you're unable to @CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter bonds people together at any age. When I was still in diapers, I watched a video titled ""I @CAPS2 to @CAPS3."" I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now, whenever that video is brought up we have a great time reminiscing about those days. Being able to @CAPS3 together has brought my family relationships to the highest point. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, but it is contagious.  Laughter can lighten a tough situation and lift everyone's spirits. It is very hard not to @CAPS3 when someone else is laughing. Everyone has their own @CAPS3 too. Sometimes, it is someone's @CAPS3 that provokes laughter within the group. Making others @CAPS3 is a wonderful feeling as well. Comedians make a career out of making people @CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @CAPS3. @PERSON1 is one of my personal favorite comedians. I @CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @CAPS3. All of one's friendships need someone who can lift the spirits higher. However, the laughter shouldn't come from making fun of someone. It should come from the situation or a circumstance that the group @MONTH1 be facing. That is key to having a good comedian in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies of how laughter can heal the body. Such things as laughter therapy is a very real treatment for troubled individuals. Norman @CAPS4' book, ""Laughter is the best medicine"" explains the powers of laughter in detail. @CAPS4 watched The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and laughed himself to wellness. He shows how one needs laughter to be well. Laughter is so very important to a person's health. It raises the spirits and lightens moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if one doesn't have enough laughter in his life, he @MONTH1 not be as healthy as he could be. If your friendships are lacking humor, seek it. Laughter is one of the most important feelings that one needs to surround themselves with throughout their entire life."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20825	8	" In this essay I will be telling you about why laughter, conflict and trust is very important in an relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other with anything. We have known and been with each other for the past @NUM1 year's of our lives.  Her name is @CAPS1. I love her more then anyone else in the world. One thing that does make us closer is that we laugh at each others mistakes. When one of us messes up the other will laugh at them and then try to help with the problem. When one of us does mess up with something we are always the first to now about what it was with or who it was with even if we do not like the other person that they are having the problems with. Conflict, I think is something else that i think is very important in a good relationship. Me and her fight all the time with each other. Even if its for the littlest and stupidest thing's. We always find one way to fight over something. If it's for the other messing up where it could or would completely mess with mine or her life. We protect each other from messing up are lives to much. We stop each other from doing really stupid things. We have strange feeling when the other is hurt or might be hurt by someone or something. Trust is something that is very important for a relationship. Trust, you can be there or tell the someone anything no matter what it is. Me and her now everything there is to now about each other. If you want to now something about me you could go to her and she could tell you. If you wanted to now something about her you could go to me and i could tell you. I could tell her anything even if she is going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me I now she would be as soon as possible. We will almost never judge the other for something they did or are going to do. We now what the other person has done and what they have not done as well. I would trust her with my life if I had to. She is my best friend, favorite cousin, @NUM2 mom, sister, and everything else to me. Me and her will always laugh at each other s mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other but we will always be there to help the other one out for what ever reason it @MONTH1 be. those are the @NUM3 thing i think you need to have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i will never be able to lose it no matter how hard i try to i now she will always be by my side."	15	18		33				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20826	8	" Bell rings.  Shuffle, shuffle. @CAPS1. Snap. EEEE. Crack. Slam. Click, stomp, @CAPS1. Tap tap tap. SLAM. Creak. Shoof, shoof.  Sigh. Seventh class of the day. Here we go. ""@CAPS2! Tu va ou pas? On a +¬tude cette class-l+á. Tu peux aller au bibliotheque si tu veux...."" @CAPS3 all blinked at me, @PERSON1, @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1, chocolate-haired and mocha skinned, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @CAPS3 didn't really care if I came or not. It made no difference to them if I trailed a few feet behind like some pathetic puppy. I was silent but adorable, loved only because I was an @CAPS4. Because I spoke fidgety @CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds, and were then forgotten about.  I was a flock of seagulls haircut. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go on exchange at all? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. No one wants you. Just go home.  But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this remember? For months and months, it was all you wanted, all you thought about, all you dreamt about. So I went with the girls. As expected, @CAPS3 walked down the three-person wide staircase side-by-side, and I shuffled awkwardly behind them. Finally arriving at @NUM2scalier, we sat at a table, the three girls talking. I glazed my eyes over, attempting to look lost in thought, as if I didn't care I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed in my head; if @CAPS3 weren't talking to me, why should I make the effort to talk to them?   I really had no idea how @CAPS3 felt about me. How does someone feel about their shadow? @CAPS3 notice it, sure, but it never offers up insight, it never makes you laugh. It's all in the confidence, said my mother's voice, all how you carry yourself. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was just too alien. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to flick peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, sproing.  This caught the interest of @PERSON1, as @NUM1le and @ORGANIZATION1 were discussing something very emotional. Tears began to pour out of @ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffling, she and @NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @PERSON1. Only @PERSON2 could have felt my felt my same emotion as he stared up at @CAPS6. Silently, I continued shooting peas. @PERSON1 just stared at them as @CAPS3 darted around the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then, he turned around and swore. And then, @PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table.  And then, we laughed.  We laughed so hard I cried. So hard that huge, alien tears flooded from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But it didn't matter, because we were dripping tears and snot, reaching for each other, reenacting the pea hitting the boy's face. It was as if we had been friends for years, and laughing happened all the time. It was saturated with all the angst and lonliness and despair I had felt the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instantaneous, like lightening, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt that huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach was aching and my cheeks were so sore I felt them seizing up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life.  Sniffle sniffle. GASP. Laughter. GASP. Swipe of tears. Sniffle sniffle. Laughter. GASP. This is why. I thought. This is why you came.

Then @CAPS2 left me alone to think. I needed to move on? How? Life wasn't that easy. I knew that. I opened up my note book to do some homework to get my mind off @PERSON2, @CAPS5, @CAPS3 @PERSON3. That's when I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I flipped it over, showing that it was a picture. A tear leaked out of the corner of eye. It was of me @CAPS3 @PERSON2. We were both in a mud pit. My blond hair looked like dirt ( considering that I had been rolling in mud). My pit bull was rubbing @CAPS1 greasy head on my shoulder smearing more mud on to myself. I smiled, missing him even more, @CAPS6 feeling a lot better then a minute before. I loved him. I loved him so much. I still do this day, @CAPS6 I had to get over that my friend was gone. After I saw the picture, I had laughed to myself, automatically feeling better about being such a horrid granddaughter @CAPS3 a inconsiderate best friend. @CAPS6 seeing the good times we had, @CAPS3 smiling, made me honestly feel better about myself.

20829	8	" The bus flew around tightly wound corners. Beyond the windows, farmland, rocky bluffs, and peaceful rivers streamed past. Exhausted from the fourteen hour flight, I barely knew what time it was. The only things keeping me awake were the jolting of the bus and @NUM1 other @CAPS1 I barely knew gossiping quietly. We were going to visit and live with a group high school students, affectionately referred to as ""our @CAPS2."" I had met @CAPS16 partner, @LOCATION1, only once. Everything I knew about her, her life, her family I learned from maybe ten, maybe @NUM2 short @CAPS3 messages. Communication was going to be problematic. @CAPS16 mother started teaching me @CAPS4 when I turned two, but I was nowhere near fluent; I was self-conscience and uncomfortable around native speakers. @PERSON1's @CAPS5 was decent, but her family spoke only @CAPS4. Finally, the bus drove down the narrow cobbled streets of @CAPS7. It pulled up to a plaza packed with people. The doors hissed open, and we filed out into the crowd, standing on tiptoes to search for our new families. All around me, people chattered in a mix of @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERSON1 and her parents waited somewhere in the middle, and I slowly wove @CAPS16 way towards them. Brigitte, @CAPS16 host mother, grabbed me in a hug. ""@CAPS10 gehts? @CAPS10 war dein @PERSON2? How @CAPS18 you? How was your flight?""  @CAPS11 of @CAPS16 @CAPS4, I faltered, ""@CAPS13 @PERSON2 war sehr langalso ich bin ein bisschen muede. The flight was very long, so I'm a little tired."" @PERSON1 took @CAPS16 arm and led me uphill towards the school, where our welcome dinner was being held. She explained, ""@CAPS14 is very excited to meet you. @CAPS7 is so small; we never get tourists. We only get @CAPS15 exchange students every other year."" @CAPS16 stomach was filled with that jittery-sick feeling of nervous anticipation. Normally, making friends was easy for me, but this time was different. I only minimally understood the language and culture of the people surrounding me. The long flight was evident in the sleepless bags under @CAPS16 eyes and @CAPS16 greasy, knotted hair. @CAPS16 jet-lagged brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in, be able to slip into @CAPS4 life without many hitches or snags? We passed from the antiquated street to a dusky tunnel-like entryway. After a few turns, we emerged into an open courtyard. An array of food covered several tables, and the scent of grilling bratwurst wafted through the air. ""@CAPS18 you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here,"" @PERSON1 told me. I grabbed a plate and placed a roll, strawberries, and a sausage on it; I was too anxious to really be hungry. @PERSON1 steered me towards a worn table with wooden benches, where her friends were already enjoying dinner and a few beers. She introduced me, and I perched stiffly on the edge of the seat. @CAPS14 talked excitedly, questioning me about @CAPS15 life. As @CAPS14 loosened up, they began to joke, sometimes in @CAPS4, sometimes in @CAPS5. Some of the @CAPS2 teased me about @CAPS16 accent. It wasn't a mean teasing; they weren't trying to be malicious, just light and funny. So I laughed. In that moment, I seemed to fit better with these people I only sometimes understood. I was less a foreigner and more a new friend. Relaxing, I allowed myself to laugh at @CAPS16 mistakes and really enjoy being someplace entirely new."	25	24		49				5	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5						
20830	8	" My friend @PERSON1 and I have @CAPS1 friends from as back as sixth grade. We have @CAPS1 through so much together. Even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out, out side of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. I say that if you are gonna have a friendship that is gonna last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. When @PERSON1 and I where in @NUM1 grade, we where the biggest people to the sixth graders because we where in the highest grade in our middle school. We would have so much stuff to do. @PERSON1 and I would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone. That someone would plow into a locker or wall and we would just laugh are butts off. It was fun to us but the other people kinda minded, but not that bad.  Another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @PERSON1 and I would have big tickle fights. It would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. I would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @PERSON1 would tickle me. @PERSON1 new that I'm like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. One time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. We tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. Well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. Well @PERSON1 was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @PERSON1 told me that she just said ""@CAPS3"" and started to chuckle. I got a big laugh out of that. Laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @PERSON1 and I wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship all started off of laughter. I met @PERSON1 in the sixth grade @CAPS4 class. Our teacher had assigned seats and @PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did I. Well the person she sat by moved away. I had a bad grade in @CAPS4 class and I told my teacher I wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere ells. He told me yes and so I went over and asked @PERSON1 if I could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. She told me that she didn't care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  So you see. Laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life's. You need it. Without it I would of never made my best friend who I have today. I have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. Without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably. Just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life."	17	16		33				3	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
20831	8	 I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played against the bull dogs in @LOCATION1. We were losing in first half and before first half got over one of our goalies got his hand hurt. So they took him out and they put in the other goalie and one of the other team players kicked the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it knocked his wind out and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying that he was going to pass out and he just got his wind knocked out of him. So then out first goalie that got injure he had to go in because no one wanted to go in as a goalie because they were to scared that they would score on them. After first half we scored @NUM1 goals so we won @NUM1 to @NUM3 . The reason that we where laughing at the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they knocked his wind out. Also because he was our friend because if he was then we wouldn't have laugh about it but after the game was over we asked him if he was alright and he said that he was just faking it even though he really wasn't.  The main reason that this was all funny was because one of our goalie got his wind knocked out and he was over reacting when he only got his wind knocked out and how he was saying that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like if he was faking it.  	14	15		29				3	2	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20832	8	" Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @CAPS7 fall @CAPS3 their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how @CAPS7 fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life that their isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and @CAPS7 always make me laugh. Their isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1 and sat down @CAPS3 a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3."" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS3, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS3 the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION2"", with two guys wearing black @CAPS3 each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS8""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS9""! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3
20833	8	" Laughter is a great thing, except for some instances. We all have been there. Having a good time with friends, laughing and making new memories. Then you take a drink of something and start laughing again. Next thing you know you're choking and can't breathe. You're coughing as much as you can, trying to stop. It's not only a little embarrassing, but it can get a little awkward too. You can't stop it, you just have to let nature take its course. Everyone stares, asking if you're alright. The moment feels like forever, and that was exactly how I felt. I have two best friends, @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. It was during the @DATE1 and we decided to have ourselves a little movie night at @ORGANIZATION3's house. We were fully prepared with candy, soda pops, and the best of all, pizza. It all added up for a great night. We decided to watch the movie @ORGANIZATION1. It's all of our favorites, I don't think we could ever grow tired of it. @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and I found comfortable seating arrangements and started to watch the movie. We were eating, laughing hard-core and making comments along with it. We were having a great time. Then I decided to take a drink of my @ORGANIZATION2. I was about to swallow it, but just my luck, one of the funniest parts in the movie was on. I started to laugh and knew I had an issue. I put my cup on the table, quickly got off the couch, and took two steps when most of the @LOCATION1 in my mouth came flying out onto the floor. I couldn't breathe and was now coughing, so I kept running to my destination, the kitchen sink. I was about two feet away from the sink, I was so close! Then I felt something come up my mouth that I couldn't control. I wasn't going to open my mouth, it'd be all over the floor! I was so grossed out I basically threw myself at the sink. My mouth opened and there went the puke, into the sink. I continued to cough, wondering when it would it would all end. ""@CAPS2 you okay?!"" @CAPS1 ran into the kitchen and started hitting my upper back, trying to help me out. @CAPS5 hit me three times, then I could finally breathe again. ""@CAPS4 you, I was having a hard time."" @CAPS5 started laughing, while I was still disgusted with the nasty taste left in my mouth. I put my head under the faucet trying to clear it out a little. I grabbed a towel, and we made our way to the living room. We entered the room to find @PERSON1 sitting on the couch, laughing hysterically. @CAPS1 sat by her, and started to giggle a little along with her. I got on my knees and started wiping up the @ORGANIZATION2 spill on the floor. There wasn't too much, but still a good amount. I started to chuckle a little to myself while cleaning it up. I thought to myself, ""@CAPS6 must I always be the one to choke?"" ""@CAPS6 didn't you just go to the bathroom sink? I mean it's right there!"" @PERSON1 was pointing to the door and still laughing. ""I didn't think of that! I just ran for the kitchen!"" I've been to her house plenty of times before, but the bathroom slipped my mind. I laughed at how much of a blond moment I had just had. ""@CAPS8 my gosh,"" @CAPS5 laughed a little then continued, ""@CAPS9 me of @CAPS10! When I saved you!"" ""@CAPS11 up and watch the movie!"" I told her jokingly. @CAPS5 finished laughing and we were enjoying the movie in peace again. They both still tease me about that, but I don't mind. It just goes to show you the things laughter can unexpectedly bring."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20835	8	" Has there ever been a person that you know, that just made you laugh like no one else could? Or had a moment or a @DATE1 when you laughed as if there was no tomorrow? Laughter is something that everyone can relate to no matter the age or the personality. It fills you with warm feeling that spills out like a waterfall. There isn't always a reason for the things that people do, there is always mystery. The same thing applies to laughter. Sometimes you are just so happy that it all builds up inside and has to be let out. During the @DATE2 of my sixth, going on seventh grade year, my friend @PERSON1 and I were nearly inseparable. @PERSON1 was the first friend that I had made upon moving from @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 in the beginning of my sixth grade year, but in a short amount of time we became best friends. On @DATE1, we were at my house by ourselves and we wanted to do something fun, and creative. So we decided to make a fort out of sheets and furniture. We took chairs and the ends of some couches and @DATE1 tables and tied sheets and blankets from them, falling over ourselves and not paying attention to anything else. We made a plane of fabric about three or four feet above the ground, tall enough to crawl under and sit down. We then took a tack in the wall and pinned a sheet to hang over the flat sheet as our walls. We then filled the make shift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on. By the @DATE1 of our adventure, the living room was a mess and the furniture was all over the place. It was as if a tornado had run through the house, even though it wasn't the biggest or best fort we had built. But we didn't care, we had a blast building it. I remember sitting in the fort and talking to her about anything that came up. We talked about school, people and just life in general. We made jokes like we love to do and just fed off of each others good feelings and energy. I was on cloud nine and no one was about to bring me down. That @DATE1, I laughed like there was nothing wrong in the world. I was carefree and wasn't afraid to show it. We were both laughing almost constantly to the point of tears, even though, when I look back now some of the things that we laughed about, weren't all that funny. It was one of those days with the laughs that fill you up with so much energy and joy that you can't even contain yourself, and it is so contagious that others can't help but join you. We let ourselves out in cries of joy and cackles. I had never laughed so hard in my life and I never wanted it to stop. It wasn't necessarily because of something funny that @PERSON1 had done or said, but I was just so happy that everything seemed worthy of laughing about. And every time I started to laugh, she couldn't help but join me, and that would just set us off laughing harder. By the @DATE1, we were both emotionally drained. @PERSON1 ended up staying the night because we never wanted the @DATE1 to leave. But, eventually, every @DATE1 ends, every morning is a new beginning and every night an @DATE1 to something, but when you close your eyes to sleep after a long @DATE1 of laughing, you feel full. Not of happiness, but of life. And that feeling, is not something that is easily taken away. So live and laugh like today is the last @DATE1, and never forget the memories that you created in the times before."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
20836	8	"         The @CAPS1 Of Laughter In @CAPS2 @CAPS3 me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @CAPS3 listen and pay attention. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. My friend @PERSON1 and I have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our @CAPS2 strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. One memory I always seem @CAPS3 remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   There have been many memories made between @PERSON1 and I that we remember because of the laughter we shared. Yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. It was our seventh grade @DATE1 and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. Now this did not really work out because I had @CAPS3 babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we did hang out it was always so much fun. Now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @CAPS2. We got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. That @DATE1 we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. Then one day @ORGANIZATION1's parent's had decided that they wanted @CAPS3 take a trip @CAPS3 the lake and go boating. @PERSON1's family invited me @CAPS3 come along, and so I asked and I was able @CAPS3 go with their family @CAPS3 the lake. I had been boating before, and @CAPS3 the lake that we were going too. What I was not expecting, was for @PERSON1 and I @CAPS3 go inner-tubing. It was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @LOCATION1 in my life.Going inner-tubing turned out @CAPS3 be one of the best memories we had ever made together. During the entire @DATE1 whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. It was our new story @CAPS3 tell everyone and we were both proud of it. When inner-tubing we had learned @CAPS3 work together and it helped our @CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also when inner-tubing we got @CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  That @DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @CAPS3 laughter. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. If not for laughter I do not know where my @CAPS2 with @PERSON1 would stand. And because of that, I believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @CAPS2. It's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20838	8	"Iv always loved laughter in my life, I don't know how I could live with out it. This is how it all started out. One day, I was not having a good day. Nothing could have made me laugh. Friends would tell my jokes, they would make funny faces. That just did'nt make me laugh one bit. There was just that one thing they have'nt tried that made me laugh, until my sister completed that one thing. I would never forget this day when my sister and I had a water balloon fight. On a hot @DATE1 day my sister and I would always play water balloon fights, this one time she through one water balloon and it hit my face. I also through one water balloon and guess what happen it hit her face. We just could not stop laughing, we were just breathless from all that laugher. My sister desided to tell me that story when I was not having a good day, even when people tried to make it better by making me laugh. The one thing no one said was that one time during the @DATE1. Until my sister reminded me of it and told me that story. I just start laughing from that day on. Then my sister took me outside, she had all the water balloons ready, we start throughing them at eachother . That day when i was not good day turned out to be the best day of my life. Thats a day I would never forget from laughter. Thats why I love laughter in my life, it just makes my not good days turn to the best day of my life."	15	12		27				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	2						
20839	8	One day me and my friend taylor got the idea on a snow day to get his quad and tie a rope to the back he was drifting around a post he didnt see the hill and i was on the back on a slead and i flew over the quad and got about @NUM1 feet high then crashed it hurt but it was so funny we both couldnt stop laughing for ten min.then we went back to his creek it was frozen about @NUM2 inch thick then i was drven the quad and he was in the back i was driving along the bank and he was on the ice then it started to crack so i went faster so he didnt fall in then after about two min the ice cracked and he went under then i got him out and i drove as fast as the quad could go and got back to his house he changed and then he just sat there and laughted for hours about what we both did.	13	11		24				3	2	3	3	2	3	3	2	3	2	2	2						
20840	8	"  In any situation laughter is used. Many times have I been in an awkward position that i have used laughter to free myself from discomfort. Laughter will never go away and you will always have it with you to use when it is needed in a revolting moment. For example, @CAPS1 a month ago i was walking to the park with my brother and some friends of mine. When we arrived there were already people at the skateboarding spot we wanted to skate at. We decided no big deal we will just go on with our business and skate. ""@CAPS2 punks! we were here first!"" one of them said. Me and my brother started yelling back. Then one of them got in my face and started talking a bunch of trash so i said something @CAPS1 him that was so funny that all his friends laughed to. He was pretty pissed of but it didn't matter because we ended up skating there anyway and nothing went down.  This just comes to show that laughter can bring us all together at any giving moment. No matter the skin color or were your from you can always be funny. Some people my be funnier than others but everyone has a sense of humor within them. You can always find the time to make a joke or come up with a clever hilarious line for some one to laugh there brains out at. Laughter is the one thing you can count on in an awkward position or when you go to a new school or have never been somewhere before. Laughter can always keep you out of fights no matter what. All around the world people are laughing at this very moment and bonding by it. It is the sign of happiness and gratefulness. Laughter has a purpose and will never disappear.Laughter is bonding. Bonding is loving. Laughter is together."	17	15		32				3	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20841	8	" As we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize that we cant live without it. Its one of those things that are always going to be with us through tough times, and the joy of life. So when people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", well there right! You can think anything you want to, but i want you to know that i have the best laughter in the world when it comes to the boy i have fallen for.  It all started on a softball tournament in bend. Our team drove there for the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed in the @LOCATION2 inn hotel. Which was very nice by the way, probably to nice for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of football players in a locker room, hence the hard practices. After our practice we go ahead and swim in the pool, even know we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two big pools, one outside, and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the inside pool because in was way to cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @PERSON3 and I go into the sauna after swimming to relax and just talk a bit. After a while two boys about our age enter the sauna while we were still in there. They acted as if they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us which was kind of awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys I'm not shy to just speak my mind and to ask them why the hell there just sitting there pretending to mind there own business, and i know for a fact that's not why. We talk a laugh for a bit and got to know each other. One of them was extremely adorable and i hit it off with him very well. It got later into the @TIME1 and it was time for all of us to head back to our rooms and say good bye for ever. Me and @PERSON3 shared a room with her parents. I had know idea that @PERSON3 gave my number to @PERSON1, the guy i kind of liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later i get a text saying ""meet me outside to walk around"". So i amused that it was him, and i got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for the @TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefooted and as cute as can be. I never laughed so hard in my life! He made me smile and feel like i could con-core everything that came my way.  About forty five minutes past, still gazing into each others eyes, feeling like it as only been a second. His friend @PERSON2 sees someone walking out a the hotel room and realizes that its his mom. They bolt off saying there goodbyes and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek for his farewell. Never in my life have i experienced something so exciting and fun, and most of all i understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that i would never see him again is what kills me. He lives in @CAPS1 and i live in @LOCATION1. How could anything possibly happen between us? Maybe some day i will meet him again. Maybe someday i would be able to talk to him again like we did that @TIME1, and just maybe, will i fall in love with him. All those maybe's have came true, because i fallowed what was right and i waited. Now sense that all happened i can ponder and relate to laughter and how it effected me in life. That is what brought us together, and I'm happy that all of that could happen so quick in my young life."	17	16		33				4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	3	3						
20842	8	" I kept my head low as I walked through the halls of the brand new school I'd been signed up to attend. Students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their gazes, I couldn't. This is what real school is like, I thought to myself. I'd always been home schooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of middle school @CAPS12 less. My dark, curly brown hair fell into my face as I entered my first class, acting. The room was warm and dimly lit as students began to recite their lines; the sets were colorful and I instantly recognized them as the garden from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I suddenly let out a small yelp as my foot caught in the doorstop, sending me tumbling into a chair.  Deep red color flooded to my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I let out a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I glanced up through my hair and a quick smile flashed across my face as I realized I was @CAPS12 longer the center of attention.  ""@CAPS1, you must be @CAPS2, the new student."" @PERSON1 said warmly.  I smiled and nodded my head slowly, ""@CAPS3, that would be me.""  @CAPS4 smiled at me just as I'd smiled at @CAPS13, but @CAPS13 smile seemed sad, ""I'm sorry dear, but all the parts for this play have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help paint the sets next class.""  I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulling out a book and quickly buried my nose into the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and I wished with all my heart that I could truly go there. I was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me.  @CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, more black than brown but @CAPS4 wore @CAPS14 @CAPS8. @CAPS13 bright blue eyes twinkled with imagination, as did @CAPS13 face. Something about @CAPS13 seemed kind. Maybe @CAPS14 was the way @CAPS13 dimples came out even though @CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @CAPS14 could have been the way @CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence.  ""@CAPS5, hello?"" I murmured, closing my book, careful to mark the page. ""I didn't mean to interrupt, but you looked all alone, and I thought I'd come over and say hello. My name is @CAPS6, but everyone calls me @CAPS7."" @CAPS4 said with another smile, making @CAPS13 dimples come out even more. I chuckled softly and returned @CAPS13 smile, ""@CAPS8, I'm @CAPS2, nice to meet you.""  ""@CAPS10, don't take this the wrong way, but you aren't from around here, are you?"" @CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile fell slightly, ""@CAPS12, I've always been home schooled, I've never actually been to a public school before.""  @CAPS13 smile fell with my own, and i could tell that @CAPS4 knew what I was talking about.  ""@CAPS14's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad that I'm finally getting to go to a public school."" I murmured, the lie coming easily.  @CAPS4 laughed and layed a soft hand on my shoulder, ""@CAPS12 need to lie,""  I knew that half of @CAPS13 words were serious, and the others playful but something deep inside of me shifted. I barely knew this girl but I felt that I could trust @CAPS13, and that we could be friends.  We laughed and joked the rest of the class, and I was almost always caught up in the way that @CAPS4 constantly got flustered while trying to explain things to me. @CAPS4'd try and use @CAPS13 hands, make movements, just to explain, which always took us into a new round of giggles because of how ridiculous we both were acting and I was startled when the bell for lunch rang, had time really passed that fast? @CAPS7 smiled at me, ""@CAPS16 for lunch @CAPS2?"" A smile broke out across my face, maybe I wasn't as alone as I'd thought. With just a few giggles and laughs, an entire friendship was planted in a ground that I'd thought was to stony to hold any life at all. By just opening myself up a little bit, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I'd opened the doorway to an entire future of conversations, to smiles, tears, secrets but above all, hope. This place was @CAPS12 longer a place of torture, exclusion and sadness, but a place where I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman who I began to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally came to realize that we weren't as different as I'd once thought. We were one and the same all along."	21	14	40	40				4	4	4	5	5	4	3	3	4	4	2	3	4	4	4	5	4	4

""@CAPS2, @CAPS4's so adorable"", they say.""@CAPS2, @CAPS4 so cute"", they say.@CAPS1.C is cute, but does things that will amaze you! Things you wouldn't think a kid his age could make possible. Like i always say, ""@CAPS4'll make you work for your money!""The thing is @CAPS4's only @NUM1 years of age, well right now @CAPS17. @CAPS4 loves the attention, @CAPS4'll do almost anything for it. Yet @CAPS4's very lovable and sometimes sweet.@CAPS4 loves comedy, cartoons, candy, video games, the works. @CAPS1.C is lots of fun believe me when i say you'll never get bored! I think when @CAPS4 was @NUM2 1/@NUM2 when the adventures began. @CAPS4 would always go in the refrigerator and just @CAPS8 at the egg cartons and double check if anyone was around. Then @CAPS4'd grab one and toss it and say, ""@CAPS5, chicken?"" with a baby type accent, so adorable! but @CAPS4'd try another and another and another until all the eggs were splattered all over the place. @CAPS4'd run off knowing we're coming to close to him and hide. I must admit i didn't know who was doing all this at first. I kind of thought it was @CAPS1.C, but wasn't too sure. That was only one mischief.@CAPS4 also loved this aquarium that was there, very bright because of the light it just seem to attract him. @CAPS4'd get closer and closer and just @CAPS8 at the fishes. Watching them swim, all the different pretty colors. The rocks and the little toys seemed to attract him more. When @CAPS5 one was around @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 above the tank and stick his hand in very carefully and say,""@CAPS7!""trying to attempt to grab it, but @CAPS5 success. When @CAPS4 heard that someone was coming or getting closer to him @CAPS4'd run so fast like the bird cartoon from loony toons always out smarting the coyote. There would be a mess, of course. Though everyone knew @CAPS4'd be trouble once @CAPS4'd start walking! @CAPS4 was so cute though.Now when @CAPS4 was between the ages @NUM4 and @NUM5, @CAPS4 just loved picking at people just for the fun of it, or so we thought. @CAPS4 do it for the attention so we'd go drop what were doing and go run after him. What @CAPS4'd do was grab something that was valuable to a certain person and go up to them and say, ""@CAPS8! me have, me have.""Of course, we had to go run after him, but sometimes you'd have to be careful because if not @CAPS4'd toss if and wham! It would brake. there's only a few things I'm pointing out here, but in reality there was much more and it was ore exciting then might be explaining it! age @NUM5 was a workout! One day we decide to lend @CAPS1.C our @CAPS10 touch to entertain him because we were busy doing our own things and @CAPS1.C discovers you tube! @CAPS4 loves this show called @CAPS12 and @CAPS13! In other words @CAPS4 calls it, ""@CAPS14 @CAPS15 @CAPS16.""@CAPS17 @CAPS4'd go on it and watch most of the t.v shows on the @CAPS10 touch and use the apps on it! @CAPS4 is very smart when it comes to using electronics if i @MONTH1 add. The day after that @CAPS4'd ask for the @CAPS10 touch almost frequently then every time @CAPS4 was denied of using it, @CAPS4'd go to his methods in getting it! Of course what @CAPS4 did was, when lights were out and everyone was asleep @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 all over, when finally @CAPS4'd @CAPS8 under the pillows and grab them and take it with him. The very next morning we were after him! @CAPS4 told us, but yet again @CAPS4 would do it! Then we went to drastic measures we hid the @CAPS10 touches else where. now at @NUM1 years of age! whoa, well @CAPS5 in my opinion I think @CAPS4 calmed down a little more. Others @MONTH1 not think so, but i know so! Anyways @CAPS4 is now @NUM1 which means @CAPS4 is now starting school! which i hear is quite entertaining for those who are not involved! They love @CAPS1.C but sometimes @CAPS4 can be a little too much, ha. @CAPS4 loves roaming around doing what @CAPS4 loves most and just having a great time, which i admire. well if i were to say one little short story about him as a @NUM1 year old I'd pick, how @CAPS5 matter what @CAPS4'd always defend his brothers! @CAPS4 wont let @CAPS5 one bully his brothers, @CAPS5 matter what the odds! i admire most about him is that!"	15	16	30	30				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3
20846	8	" Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is to become amused or derisive. Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Through many relationships no matter what kind, I believe laughter takes up at least @PERCENT1 of your relationship. It's to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening. There are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter. ""I'm sure you can even think of one"".  In my views of this world and our society today, I believe laughter is what makes up our ""human"" spirit. It's to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us. Have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh? I have asked myself this same question over and over. For me making people laugh is letting them know I care and to also think I'm funny as well. We even do it just the fact of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go to the extremes of being to funny, and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way.  I remember in the eighth grade, I was thirteen years old. I was really shy and didn't have much friends. One day in class some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me. I was @CAPS1 excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what anyone else was saying. Then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time, because some of the things she was saying were true. That's were I messed up, I started talking about all the other dumb things she did, just to make everybody else laugh. As I was sitting there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just to try and make myself popular. Later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do that to her. I told her I was sorry and that I only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids. We didn't talk for almost two weeks. @CAPS1 I tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back. It did take me awhile, but she finally came around and forgave me. It was a good life lesson for me, knowing laughter @MONTH1 not always be a good thing. Now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day. We both together can share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down. I have experienced these things as well in my life time.

Two days ago, my @CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was groaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I already had passed the essay, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat in my chair and logged into my account.  After a few minutes my computer finally loaded, and I could log into @CAPS2. Once I got there I logged in, and my computer froze. I had noticed that some of the other students computers had also frozen. I laughed at them for their computer being frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes my account finally logged in, and I selected to take the essay. After my computer being frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message, and it logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to @MONTH1 of the other students, and I laughed because of my my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was white. I logged back in and it froze for a while.  I tried logging in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates also had gotten these error messages, or their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts, my test finally loaded, and I could begin the test. After debating for a moment, my teacher told the whole class to log off because only a few members had been able to make it to the test. I then logged off, and logged back into @CAPS2. My computer started to log me in, but then it froze and logged me out of @CAPS2. This had also happened to many of the other students taking the test. After trying to log in, the farthest I could reach was waiting for my @CAPS7 to approve me. My @CAPS7 said that he had approved me several time,s but nothing had worked.  After a few minutes of my computer not letting take the test, I logged off of my account, and got back on. At this time, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I wasn't able to get back to my test. By now over half the period had gone by. No one, not even the @CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing being able to work, the class was almost over. My @CAPS7 told us to log off the computers and wait for another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room, I thought it was going to a very boring period. I was wrong, in a good way. The class wasn't boring, and I spent much of it laughing.Although I didn't get my essay done, it was a good class. This was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time."	15	20		35				3	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20848	8	" Laughter is something everyone needs in their life. We all need some humor, and even sometimes, we need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile and a sense of humor to live life to it's fullest. When people take things other have said, differently, or even thinking a joke was said way too harsh, and they take it the wrong way. People told me, ""you need a sense of humor, you know?"" @CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back, my sophomore year, I was going through a rough time. With friends, and family becoming more and more apart from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say, through the first four to five months of sophomore year, it was hard trying to crack at a simple joke. Once, sophomore year was coming to a close, I realized there was more to life @CAPS1 moping around in my own self-pity. It was getting close to @DATE1 vacation and I know I wanted to make @DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and that no one would ruin it for me. After from being all sad and not having any fun, and laughing at the jokes my dad made about me, I know I needed to hang out with him a lot more. When my dad and I hung out, we had more laughs @CAPS1 I couldn't even remember having. It was a really good memory to have. Especially with my dad. My self-esteem was getting a lot better @CAPS1 it use to be. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I had a better relationship with my dad, too. So far, life was going great for me. I realized that I was more happy when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say, I never smiled, nor laughed as much as I did in a while. The truth about me was that I was diagnosed with gender identity disorder. I didn't go through any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and it was probably why I was so sad my sophomore year. When I discovered myself, I knew there was a lot more to life @CAPS1 getting a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and just appreciate everything and everyone wanting to become my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was a really good feeling knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called, and what a trans-gender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure, and most of all; happy. I know I was going to get more harassment down the road from coming out. I got a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I laughed at all of them who sent me hate mail, calls, and text messages. It was really worth the laugh, because I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know a thing about transgenders, or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived through a hot @DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for it to start, and even more excited for the sports ahead of me. I knew I was gonna kick butt my junior year and not let anyone get in the way of it. When it was around my birthday, like, a month into the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to just make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know I needed it more in my life. There was a girl that started talking to me on @CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality fit her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would end up burning. Her name was @PERSON2, and that also fit her, everything was just so great about her. We ended up talking on the phone at twelve, in the @TIME1, on my birthday. By far, that was the best night I had in a while and the sweetest thing anyone has every done for me. @PERSON2 and I hung out that weekend at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, in @LOCATION1. When we headed up there her friend, @PERSON1, was singing to the songs by @CAPS5, while @PERSON2 mocked her squeaky voice. I never laughed so hard that my stomach would cringe in pain. So, you see, having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to have. You even have to laugh at yourself and make fun of how idiotic you sounded. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when they make your heart melt, and give you butterflies every time they say something sweet to you. Even just to make your @CAPS2 light up with a smile."	15	15		30				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20849	8	" In a relationship you should be able to trust in each other, confide in each other, talk with each other, cry with each other and most importantly laugh with each other. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can definitely agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I totally get the most laughter out of is the relationship between me and my best friend, and boyfriend, @PERSON2. He can always make me laugh, even on my worst days he can find a smile and a little giggle. I constantly thank @CAPS1 for putting him in my life.  The first thing that I really noticed about @PERSON2 when I started to get to know him better, is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he is making totally weird faces at me or tickling me until I can barely breath, he always knows how to get me laughing. When I am balling my eyes out to him, even then he can get me to giggle. Just @TIME1 I had had a terrible day at school and within a few minutes of me crying to him, he had cheered me up and got me to laugh. In church or with friends we will just look at each other and make a face and start laughing, there's something about those blue eyes and that dorky smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been a great aspect of our relationship since the beginning. When we play @CAPS2, or he plays and I fail at attempting to play, we always laugh at how bad I am at it, or when I finally do get an awesome kill. ""That just works out, don't it!"" is one of our inside jokes, obviously it's not all that funny but we have fun competing at who can say it the most in one day. The rule is you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always playfully argue over who won or gets ""the point"" (as if we actually keep score) but that usually gets us laughing at some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us tries to use. When ever there is a camera around @PERSON2 likes to make funny faces, which will always get me laughing. Then we usually end up taking somewhere around twenty silly pictures and just going through them and laughing and laughing at all of the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing it usually gets the other one laughing too, they do say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with and around each other you have to be able to laugh at your self. One time, @PERSON2 his little sisters, @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 and I were all seeing how high we could kick and long story short I kneed myself in the forehead, @PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard the crack of my bones hitting each other with force, and he just got silent until I started cracking up. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks were bright red from embarrassment too, but I just laughed it off. Another time we were goofing around on the hard wood floor at his house and I pushed him to the ground, his whole family was cracking up and his face was bright red, but he just laughed it off. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other we both have the ability to laugh it off.  Even when things get rough our you disagree on something it is always good to later be able to look back on it and laugh about it with each other. Just because @PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree about a lot of things most are small but once in a while we will disagree on something a little bigger. At times one of us will do or say something that upsets the other one, we are always able to work it out and later look back on it and laugh even when it is a touchy subject. Both of us have made mistakes in our past too but again we just look back and laugh.  Obviously I have reason too agree with the statement ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" because I have that connection in the best way possible. I am so thankful to have @PERSON2 in my life, his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between ""@CAPS3"" over a text message, cracking up at weird things we do or just watching a movie, we are always laughing at each other or with each other. As we both would put it ""were freaking soul mates!"""	21	23		44				4	4	4	4	5	4	5	5	5	4	5	4						
20850	8	" Every day I spend with my girlfriend is a day full of fun and laughter. I can be in the worst of moods and she can brighten my whole day with @CAPS1 a couple of words. Together we can chane any situation into a happy one. What i'm trying to say is that laughter is a very powerful thing @CAPS1 by making someone laugh, you can change their mood, their day or in some cases maybe change their whole life. People say that laughter is very contagous. I beleive that is true. Take comedians for example, they can take any situation and make a whole room burst with laughter. My favorite one is when this one comedian said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 shivering in the cold, we will bring him silver and gold"", like the song. He then said "" @CAPS4 don't they @CAPS1 bring him some blankets, I meen come on, the poor kid is going to die of hypothermia but at least he will be rich when he does"". I wrote this paper to show how powerful laughter is in the world. I beleive that everyone should laugh at least once a day to make the world a brighter place.   I conclude with this "" A smile can light up a room but laughter can change the world into a happier place"". Nobody should go through life without laughter. "" A life without laughter is a life not spent""."	16	15		31				3	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20851	8	"A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago @CAPS4 I meet my friend @CAPS1. I meet her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's @CAPS4, @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, ""@CAPS3 watch where your going!"" @CAPS4 we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS5 its @CAPS6, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk."" We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved band. @CAPS1 and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS4 you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS1 until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way."	15	17		32				3	3	4	4	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	3						
20852	8	" Laughter is a very important part of life, for many different reasons. Some @MONTH1 say that its vital to survive, one needs laughter to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. This is a statement I myself believe, and have concluded from the actions and outcomes in my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone either depressed or happy. It is true when someone says there is a difference when someone is laughing at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laugh with me, its an amazing, self esteem raising emotion. This laughter brings friends closer, and causes us to trust each other more. One time I thought laughing was appropriate at the time but then later felt awful. One scorching @DATE1 day my friends and I decided to venture to the mall, being we lived in apartments and lacked the money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a splendid idea. When we reached the mall we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors swung open, as if to greet us. All of us are very introverted so shopping around in an over crowded mall wasn't our cup of tea. Not knowing what to @CAPS1 we sat on a bench and did what we call people watching. Their was this girl, I will always remember her; @CAPS4 was one of those girls you peer at just for a minute and you know @CAPS4 was rich. A sort of stuck up girl, a walk where @CAPS4 means to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleach blond hair.  The girl passed by us and stuck her nose in the air as if we were not even remotely good enough to be in her presence. Quite a bit angry I stood up after @CAPS4 strolled past and mocked her strut. My friends found this hysterical. Roars of laughter leaped from their mouths. The pressy girl stopped proceeding forward and then started approaching us. @CAPS4 grimaces at us all snobby-like and says, ""@CAPS1 you guys like have a problem or something?"" @CAPS2 covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Fortunately my best friend stepped in and said, ""@CAPS3, we think your dress is very pretty."" @CAPS4 believed us, then walked off, in a rather less snobby sort of way.  Through this weird and interesting experience my friends and I learned a lot. One, people can hear you talking crap about them from a mile away. Two, laughter can bring friends together, but can also have some consequences. I @CAPS1 not know for sure if @CAPS4 did hear or see us mocking her. But I knew inside I felt a little bad. Sure laughing at her in the time felt right, amusing. Looking back on it, I feel awful. I have been in that same situation but on the receiving end. It is not pleasant having people talking crap about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughing is very vital to life but needs to be appropriate."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

I really didn't mind the fact that he wasn't eating with me. Icontinued eating, I separated the food by colors to make a face on my plate. it turned out looking pretty great, he looks over and says""whats that supposed to be?"" with a smirk on his face""its a face!... see the carrots are the nose the shrimp are the eyes the greens and , noodles form the mouth and hair"" I look up with a smile ""wanna take a picture of my face on the plate ?"" I say ""nope""he answers ""@CAPS4"" I answer backI mix up all the things again and continue eating my food when I'm done I get up , put the plate in the sink go back to the table and sit down. @PERSON3 gets up goes outside brings more wood for the fire place and starts lighting it. I go up ask him if hes mad he says yes now I'm sad. I say I'm sorry we talked it over and it turned out that he was mad because I didn't let him take a picture of my food. after five minutes were happy again @PERSON1 suggests that we go to @CAPS5 we all agreed. when we got their we all ordered our food and waited.""lets to the wrestling mat!?""we all said at the exact time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 stayed waiting for the order while @PERSON3 and I when to go play in the little kid toys. we were fighting our way in to the wrestling mat when we noticed that all the little kids were staring at us like they had never see older kids play . we continued our little game of kicking, punching, slapping and scratching each other. i decided that i need a time out so I sat up and took long breaths.out oh the onwear I hear this weird noise I look over and asked him if he had farted he looked at me with a cheese smile and after five second he repiles yes. and continued farting but the room seemed quiet too quite we looked a round to see that all the littlte biys and girls heard him too! their were to little girls standing at the entrance a little boy a few feet away from @PERSON3 and two other little kids by the slide.I guess they were shocked i started laughing to tears, ran out of the play room to go tell @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 what had just happen they too thought that it was hilarious."	15	17		32				3	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20856	8	"                                @CAPS4 @CAPS1 Laughter is a powerful tool when you know how to use it. It has the ability to inspire, when in doubt. Lift heavy spirts to new heights, and it can also create great devotion, to a person, thing or cause. So what has laughter done for you and I? Well it has done lots for me, a good example would be my experience in the @ORGANIZATION2.  At @CAPS2 middle @ORGANIZATION3 I had everything going for me. I had good grades, teachers, but most of all a group of friends that I could share many laughs with. When we graduated and went to @ORGANIZATION3 my friends either moved or dispersed into other groups. It was horrible not to have anyone to laugh with, making things pretty tough. Then came the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 program, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Since I wasn't really envoled in the program I didn't have any friends, save vanecek. Then an opportunity it join the @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION4 arose, I took it. Every afternoon for one hour we had practice, which in turn created a strong bond between the @ORGANIZATION4 members. Before shooting we would laugh it up and relax, making it a fun enviroment to shoot. The @ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @CAPS4 @CAPS1, due to all the laughter heard outside the range. The @ORGANIZATION2, which my battalion as a part of, hosts five competitions a year. With fourteen schools from across @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition we had been with one another long enough to consider one another family. My family, seeing how I was nervous, took me aside the night before the shoot-out. We played cards, talked and cracked jokes, it was the one of the most special times of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous just relaxed. Out of twenty four man teams we took third, not bad for a new famliy. Since then the @ORGANIZATION4 has taken first, four times in a row. Those victories I have to give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter in a way has inspired me to devote myself to a family, and has taken me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @CAPS4 @CAPS1 are you part of?"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20857	8	" Seeing one of @CAPS15 best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. Its was the @DATE1 after @CAPS15 @NUM1 grade year of school. I was having @CAPS15 friends @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and @CAPS15 neighbor @PERSON1 stay the night at @CAPS15 house. @CAPS25 ever we got bored we usually went around @CAPS15 neighborhood ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" some houses to have some fun. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"" is @CAPS25 @CAPS21 quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then @CAPS23 run away. All four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great @DATE1 day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.@CAPS25 it came to night fall we were all in @CAPS15 room playing @CAPS7 @NUM2.  ""I'm bored bro,"" @PERSON2 said to the other three of us.  ""@CAPS8 then, think of something to @CAPS19,""@CAPS9 replied  ""I can't think of anything,"" @PERSON1 stated with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something to @CAPS19 to entertain the four of us. ""I got it!"" I said with a confident smirk ,""lets go @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!"" "" I down for that ,""@PERSON2 said ""@CAPS13 me too ,""@CAPS9 and @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2. As we were walking out @CAPS15 front door @CAPS15 mom shouted ,""where are @CAPS21 boys going?"" @CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say ,""uh, we are going on a walk ,""I replied hesitantly.  ""@CAPS16 be safe,"" @CAPS15 mom said as I walked out of the door. We @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. I came up with the best idea I have thought of yet.  ""@CAPS18 this is what needs to happen, I'm going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28 the first house, @PERSON2 @CAPS21 get the next one, @PERSON1 @CAPS21 get the house at the corner and @PERSON3 will run around the corner to get the last house.   ""@CAPS19 @CAPS21 think that will work?"" @PERSON1 asked.  ""@CAPS20 yes it will work!"" I said,""@CAPS21 @CAPS18 ready?""   ""I guess so ,"" @PERSON1 replied shortly after @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the first door bell and started running, then I saw @PERSON2 slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @PERSON1 ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.  ""@CAPS9 get the last house!"" I shouted at him. The house @CAPS9 was running to did not have their porch light on. @CAPS9 was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK! @CAPS9 tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. I could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  He got up quickly and turn to us in confusion ,""should I ring the door bell? Should I ring it?""  ""@CAPS23 run @CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear @CAPS21 smack their screen door with your face!"" @CAPS25 we got back to @CAPS15 house everyone was laughing. @CAPS9 @CAPS23 made our night. That happened @NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. So next time one of your friends ask @CAPS21 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS28"" a house think about if the porch lights are on. "	18	20	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3
20859	8	" ""@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my purse is."" I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS7. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS8 to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	5	4						
20860	8	"                     Laughter is a key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in an akward situation or help you become closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe that both of those statements are true. Personally laughter has dramatically changed many different social situations throught my @NUM1 years of life.  One time in particular that I remember laughter really bringing me closer together with other people is when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious stuff, family and friend problems and just sharing our hardships in general with eachother. I didn't really have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved along with good friends. However that evening I was learning some interesting but disturbing information about my friends home life. She started to talk about how her parents don't care and how they are both alcoholics, I could tell by her tone of voice how painful admitting this information was for her. The mood had suddenly changed from discussing light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She continued to tell me how alone she felt sometimes and how she just always wished she could be with her friends because we always have a good time.   After she told me all of this we laid in silence for a while. Neither of us were asleep but I had no idea what to say. I mean how could anything I say make that situation better or help her to feel better. While we had been having this conversation our other friend had run back to the car to grab sodas and go to the bathroom. We heard her saying our names and searching for us in the dark. All of a sudden she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag fell on us and spilled a bunch of fizzy grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought this was hysterical. While in the midst of laughing like crazy people I looked at my friend who had just recently told me her painful story, now she was crying from laughing so hard and I knew that a little laughter had brought us closer.  That is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I feel laughter has played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and close. Similar experiences have occured throughout my whole life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to one another. Maybe it brings people closer together because when you are legitimatley laughing you are so caught up in it that you forget about everything else. All of your problems disappear."	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	5	4	4	3
20861	8	"                     Laughter Laughter has always played a significant role in the relationships of @CAPS2 life. Being able to laugh with someone creates a bond with that person.Through laughter, I was able to become friends with a person that I can call to this day @CAPS2 best friend. I met the person that would later on become @CAPS2 best friend through one of @CAPS2 friends. A few friends of mine and I were hanging out and @CAPS2 friend, @PERSON1, said, "" @CAPS1 know @PERSON2, @CAPS1 should talk to a good friend of mine.""I didn'@CAPS4 oppose to the idea because from what @PERSON1 told me about her, it seemed like it would be very easy for me to get along with her. About ten minutes later, I looked down at @CAPS2 cell phone and noticed that I had a text message from a number that I did not know. I asked who the person was and waited for a response. Two minutes pass by and I get a message that says, ""@CAPS2 name is @ORGANIZATION2. I am the girl the curly-headed kid sitting next to @CAPS1 told @CAPS1 about."" Once I read this I started just about busted up into a fit of laughter. Never would I have thought a girl I had never spoken to would be brave enough,or sarcastic enough, to say something like that as the first thing they would say to me. For the next few hours, we kept exchanging sarcastic remarks and jokes and the laughs just kept on coming. @ORGANIZATION2 is the type of person that can make anyone laugh. This is what I love about her; @CAPS3 possesses a talent of making anyone laugh no matter where they are, what kind of mood they are in, or what they are doing. We have walked around for hours and we have spent a majority of that time having to stop and catch our breath because we had been laughing so hard. Our ability to laugh with each other has helped us through difficult times in our lives. @ORGANIZATION2's mom passed away a few years ago and this sent her into a depressive state. @CAPS3 rarely felt any happiness until we would talk. Our ability to start laughing at one another helped her throughout this time. I recently received a @CAPS4.B.I. or @ORGANIZATION1. I felt numb to the world. Nothing felt the way that it once felt. Luckily for me, @ORGANIZATION2 was able to come in and do what I had done for her; @CAPS3 was able to make me laugh and feel normal again. Having the ability to laugh with @ORGANIZATION2 has definitely made our friendship stronger than it would have been had we not been able to laugh together. Being able to laugh doesn'@CAPS4 just effect that one moment in time, nor does it just impact one person. Having laughter means so much more than that. Being able to laugh creates bonds that are simply not possible without laughter. I have felt what laughter can do to a relationship and I can say that it most definitely feels good."	19	20	40	40				3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20862	8	" ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 society today loves laughter. From comical shows to hilarious friends, people have fun convulsing with glee. Not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. Everyone that texts @MONTH1 use ""@CAPS3"" or ""haha"" to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having, ""a smile that burst.""  I couldn't wait. I was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. Because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping @CAPS4. Jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. After the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. Jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  We headed into the crisp air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. As the hill got steeper, we started walking. Jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. Everyone started laughing again. The walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  When we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. Eventually, @CAPS5 pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. Again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. At last, the astonishing sunrise happened. It was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. I peered over the edge and saw a little path. With a bunch of convincing, I got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  The first part of the path was simple. As we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. A couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So on we went. ""@CAPS6 no!"" @CAPS7 yelled. We turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. She had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. Suddenly, @PERSON1 tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @PERSON2 forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. While flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if I didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. While she was in the bush, she grabbed @PERSON2's shoe. The hard part was getting @PERSON1 out.  The first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. Finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. @PERSON1 was super embarrassed. After all of that, we headed down the hill. We still had giggles while trotting down the trail. As we went, we saw animal tracks. We then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. A couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. Eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. With out it, we could have been very grumpy. Also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important. When writing this paper to the @ORGANIZATION1's in @LOCATION1, I told my friends about the adventure we went on and the predicament we got ourselves into. They laughed hysterically, since they knew the girls. Laugh often to be happy."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	5	5						
20863	8	" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 best friend @PERSON1. Wow! All those great times last @DATE1 and all the ones to come. Some people think were weird but if you knew us you would understand. Sometimes people say, ""I'm going to die laughing."" @CAPS2 i know I am because of @PERSON1, she knows how to always make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together i could there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times.  First of all, this friendship started the @DATE1, and now we are in sophomore @DATE1 of high school. We've been friends for one @DATE1 and eleven months and six days. We are the best of best of friends.  So last @DATE1 when we were learning the cheers for football season, all most every-time we got done with a cheer, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I would say, ""@CAPS3-in @CAPS4."" That was our saying, and we always did it @DATE1 and after the football or basketball games. We called it our @CAPS3-in @CAPS4 style or for short our slogan. We would be having a blast and laughing for hours.  ""@CAPS5 turn, @CAPS6 turn,"" In @DATE2 we were on our way to state for cheer. On the car ride up to @LOCATION1, every-time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. Oh @CAPS1 goodness we laughed and we had a blast. After the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 turns, there was another motion we called the monkey and we would act like monkeys. It was so much fun we laughed. We also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really bad.That was one of many car rides that was amazing.  On the other hand, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I, cheer together, we have sleepovers, @CAPS2 i should say that we do everything together. She is @CAPS1 cheer sister and will always be, also she is @CAPS1 best friend.I would do anything for her. I love @PERSON1 @PERSON1.  In addition, to the we do everything together. When @PERSON1 is over at @CAPS1 house I always have to make sure I make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so i went and made all of that and @PERSON1 loved it so now i have to make sure i have some for her when she comes over. Now we always talk about the becomes of the sandwich habit.b we laugh about it all the time.  Finally, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever, because i don't know what i would do with out @CAPS1 sister. I would not be the person who I am today with out her she and everything to me we laugh even when we want to cry she is everthing to me. You could say we have a perfect freindship of all time. @CAPS1 bestfriend is @CAPS1 sister I love you @PERSON1, thanks for alays having @CAPS1 back.

20865	8	" It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy."	20	18		38				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4						
20866	8	" It was one of those days where I just sat around all day doing nothing, but play @PERSON2, text, and laugh at myself. It was one of those days where no one bothered me; no one even really talked to me; no one told me to do chores. By dinner time someone decided to call me up stairs to eat, but let me tell you, it wasn't anything like pizza. Although I'd rather eat it than get a lecture on not being thankful. My brother came home for the first time in ever, ate with us, then decided to leave again. But this time I asked to come with; I'm so tired of beating @PERSON2. He said no, of coarse. I made my daddy change his mind for him, of coarse. I don't see why he wouldn't let me come in the first place. He was going to hang out with the guys I grew up with, my friends, not his. Anyways. I got ready then we hit the road. There him and I were, laughing about dinner and what kind of music my mom listens to, on our way to pick up my friends. These guys are great! All we do is crack jokes about each other and crack up. But let's get down to business. I didn't tell you this, but it's @DATE1 time, around The @CAPS1 of @DATE2. Fireworks are for sale and we're creating ""bombs"" out of them. Or they are. Since I'm a girl, I guess I'm not allowed, or something lame like that. But there is this girl my brother likes and I guess he wants to impress, excuse me ""impress"" her by showing up at her house so she can see these ""master pieces"" they've made. That just makes me feel bad for him, but honestly just made me laugh. Maybe she'll be impressed. Key word: maybe. Although, no, it won't. Because to this day they are still only friends.  So about these bombs. Complete duds. We tried, well I just watched, over and over again to make 'em work, but they wouldn't do a thing. Eventually my friend @CAPS2 put a whole bunch of @CAPS3 @CAPS4's into my favorite stuffed animal. It just made a bunch of sparkly colors and loud noises, but it was pretty fun to watch. We got in on video too, it was a total good laugh for everyone. After my brother said goodbye to his ""girl,"" we decided to head home. The thing is, we had so many fireworks left! We know this kid @PERSON3 who lives somewhere on the way home. So we decided to go by his house, have @CAPS2 get out of the truck, light the firework on his porch, have him jump in the tail of the trunk, then drive off as fast as we could. The first time we did it we couldn't stop laughing. They didn't come out of their house, so we did it again. They still didn't come out. We did it about one more time, by then all the neighbors were out. They were all so confused. That just made us laugh even more. It was so great we wanted to keep doing it, but to someone else this time. We know this girl @PERSON1 who lives near all of us. We thought, why not? It's not gonna hurt to stop there real quick and have some fun with her too. Apparently she thought different. Way different, actually she thought it was the rudest thing ever. We were just joking around, gettin' a laugh out of all our fun. We weren't being rude, she's our friend. Long story short, her mom got mad too and chased us down in her car. She never caught us, but she got our license plate number. The next day, on The @CAPS1 of @DATE2, she called the police. They didn't think it was a big deal, but they still showed up at my house and talked to my parents about what went down. I was at my boyfriend's so lucky me I only had to talk to my mom on the phone about it. She realized we were just having fun and actually laughed about it too. That @CAPS1 of @DATE2 @CAPS8 was great. It was one of those nights where you laughed the whole time and wouldn't change a thing even if you got in trouble with the law for it. Something I will definitely never do again, but I'm so glad I have this hilarious memory to reminisce on for the rest of my life."	20	17		37				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3						
20869	8	"                                        A day with the family  One day my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and i had gone out to eat at @ORGANIZATION2 for breakfast. They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the old days made them all want to hangout more often. They always had @CAPS2 much fun together. I grew up with my cousins around a lot of the time. We would always hangout. We started talking about all the crazy times we have had, and it was nice to hear abut the old days. We were just laughing up a storm. All a sudden out of @CAPS1 where my cousin @PERSON1 farts. All of us start busting up laughing. @PERSON1 continues to fart while she is uncontrollably laughing. @CAPS2 many people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here was a group of people all laughing, and one of them cannot stop farting. The laughing got louder as well as the farting. my mother could not take it anymore. She took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table. She wanted to drowned out the sound of @LOCATION1's farts. @PERSON1 was beat red. We were all laughing @CAPS2 hard we started crying. We were almost to the point were we were going to pee ourselves. @PERSON1 could not hold it any longer. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @CAPS2 bad she could not even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom she had to walked there cross legged, and very slowing. All the way there she was still laughing, and we were also laughing. We had fun watching her have to stop every @CAPS2 often @CAPS2 she would not pee on herself. One time that she had stop it was right on these two guys chairs. She just stood there laughing cross legged over these two guys trying her best not to pee. The guys did not really do anything they just sat there waiting for her to go away. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I told my mom ""I would be uncomfortable to if i had some random girl bent over me laughing, and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they did not move. i would have"".  Finally @PERSON1 got to the bathroom. Those two guys had left, and when she came out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her we could not help but laugh. She laughed with us @CAPS2 we did not feel bad about laughing. People were still looking at us, and @PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go @CAPS2 we left and talked about it the whole way home. They were coming over to our house to play bored games. When we got home my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is kinda like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers team. My brother went first. He started melting to the ground. I shout out ""wicked witch of the west""! He frowns at me and says, ""@CAPS1, watch before you shout things out."" @CAPS2 i sat there and watched. He did his whole melting thing again,but when he got to the floor he started rolling and jerking around. I was @CAPS2 confused. My cousins shouts out ""poop""! My brother yells ""@CAPS3, why would anyone want to be poop""! We all start laughing,and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall.  It was my turn to go, and i got horse. I did not want to be a horse. I did not even know how to be a horse without making sound. I went up there and started hoping around like and idiot. I felt @CAPS2 dumb. My team mates made me feel even worse because they could not guess what i was for the life of them. The buzzer rang and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really mad, and ran up the stairs. On his way up there he trips on his face, and falls down the stairs. We all started laughing, and that made my brother even more mad. He went up the stairs again without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of the @TIME1.  The rest of us stayed downstairs, and played more games. It was a really fun day. I got to hangout with the family, and get a great laugh. hanging out with the family is something everyone should love. It is one of those things that just make you feel good.

20870	8	" Laughter is important, we all know that. It makes life easier, happier and even helps you live longer. It's also very important to relationships. When talking about preference in significant others it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, this is why. this story is , however, not about dating. It is about how laughter can cause you to go from hating someone one moment to being their best friend the next.  I had known @PERSON1 for a while for a few months at this point, I had met him on the bus. He was pale, skinny, loud, and he always had something funny and offensive to say. He was a shut in. Before I met @PERSON1 I could dish it out but I couldn't take it. I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to befriending him, we were fighting about something so insignificant that I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Although I do remember what he said. He said that I was a ""hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would go around making fun jokes at other peoples expense but would get up in someones face if they tried one at me."" this made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right but because it made me realise that @PERSON1 was actually a pretty good guy whose only real problem was that he didn't know when to shut up. Throughout the whole time I have known @PERSON1 he has never stopped smiling. He laughs off everything from stepping in dog crap to his fathers drug addiction he can dull the pain of any blow with laughter. @PERSON1 is my constant reminder to never stof laughing."	16	15		31				3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3

I had noticed @CAPS10 was not really himself on all these pills. His abnormality was taking a toll on the family. Through all these stressful times, we were also worried about @CAPS6 stepmother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also stress of having @CAPS6 fathers business being the main income, and him not being able to work. @CAPS6 father felt helpless, his leg was to weak for him to be doing anything.@CAPS10 would micromanage everything, and tell @CAPS4 were doing things all wrong. The was starting to cause a lot of tension within the house.  Today was the day. Isabelle (@CAPS6 little sister) and I were left alone with @CAPS6 with dad for the first time.I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in @CAPS6 room. Father asked asked if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with full hands I said ""@CAPS5, but I will when I'm done."" @CAPS6 father took that as disrespect, and hobbled over to me with his crutches. @CAPS10 was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back i headed to @CAPS6 room.The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to @CAPS6 room. That's when it happened. @CAPS6 father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting @CAPS6 knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Slamming the door luckily I had the phone and I called @CAPS6 grandmother. I told her on a voice mail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted @CAPS6 sister and I telling us it would be okay. @CAPS6 grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then @CAPS6 dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @CAPS10 used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then @CAPS10 started making fun, and jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreeing @CAPS6 dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after @CAPS10 told some jokes, @CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why @CAPS10 was sorry. I liked that which made the rest of the day quite a joy.  "" @CAPS7 made laughter to be a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 medicine, @NUM1 minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of @CAPS2 @CAPS3."" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a @DATE1 service talked about this. Laughter can truly mend a broken heart. The @CAPS2 that @CAPS6 sister an I went through that day was all over after the laughter @CAPS6 father gave us. ""Laughter can save us."" @CAPS10 also stated. After this day I believe with a little humor @CAPS6 father an I's relationship can get through anything. I would never let one mistake control a life time bond.

My favorite comedian is adam sandler because he is very funny and has a good sense of humor, he knows how to keep a person laughting and interested in his comedy shows and movies.when he made the big daddy movie @CAPS1 was pritty good not to funny but @CAPS1 was good.My secound favorite comedian is @PERSON1 because he is funnyer that adam sandler by a lil bit but not quit as good though he also stars on a tv show called wild'n out that show really makes me almost cough out my lungs, especially when they bust out with youre mama jokes @CAPS1 keeps you laughting and keeps the blood pumping thru youre body.so we all pritty much under stand what laughing is but most people dont really seem to laugh at things that are funny i cant quit undersatnd @CAPS1 but my guess is tha t they dont have a good sene of humor but some people seem to lautgh at thing that dont even make sense i quit dont undestand that either but i guess its better to laugh than to not laugh at all. Some really good comedy movies that i can mention out right off the the bat that will keep you tuned and laughing thru more than half off the movies are grandmas boy, happy gillmore, dont be a menace to south central while siping my juice. Also zombie land @CAPS1 is a heck of a good movie, i dont know its not just about making a funny movie just to make the oudience laugh @CAPS1 is the way they make @CAPS1 and how thery act and how good the backround story to the comedy movies is gonna be thats what i pay atencion to when ever i sit down and inspect what makes the movie funny also if i cant understaand a funny movie i see @CAPS1 again and again till i understand what is so hallariouse about @CAPS1.That pritty much covers the basics on laughter there are is youre basic information and what you need to knowabout @CAPS1 and how to enjoy @CAPS1 and use @CAPS1 wisely cause remamber dont laught to hard because you dont want to end up pulling a ""whotammy"" in front off every one that around thank you for reading my test."	15	18	32	32				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	3	5	3	4	3	4	3	3	3
20876	8	" Laughter is the cure to a sickness and the medicine to somebodies pain. Laughter can mend a friendship to make two strangers become the best of friends. A person can ask anybody on the street of how much laughter is important in life and they would say that laughter is very important. It's like love, everyone needs a little of it in their life and like laughter, it helps a person grow and become an adult. A person can use laughter to help them with anything like getting a job, or trying to get the girl, or just having a good time and making new friends. It's one of the main elements of life that make a person how they are and what they do. In the @DATE1 I was introduced to a girl named @DATE3, by my cousin @PERSON1. She started talking to me and I was shy because she was a girl and I wasn't used to talking to girls. I cracked a joke and that made her and I laugh together and that was the first icebreaker to making a new friend. The days went by and we were text messaging each other each day over the phone, making jokes about how our day was and making jokes about each other. Eventually we started talking to each other over the phone. Teens these days usually don't use the phone to call people and that makes emotions hard to understand because talking over text hides emotions from one another. @DATE3 called me and we would talk to each other until late in the @TIME1, to where we would both fall asleep and leave the phone on, and again we would always be making jokes about everything. Making each other laugh was one of our only connections with each other since she went to a different school. Making her happy was what I needed to do, and one of the ways to make her happy was to make her laugh or just be a charming young gentlemen because I was raised that way.  @DATE2 formal was coming near and I was in need of a date. @DATE3 was my best option for a date since I was getting close to her and I was starting to get attached to her. When I had the chance I asked her to be my date for the @DATE2 formal which would be one of the most special nights of my freshmen year. The day of the formal came and we danced the @TIME1 away and of course I had to make a few jokes about other things which made everyone laugh and have a good time. Near the end of the dance I asked her to be my girlfriend and she accepted. She said I was funny, and nice, and cute which was good. We had a fun time because good humor and fun kept the @TIME1 alive. The next @DATE2 formal, the same thing happened with a different girl except that laughter was an important key and that made the @TIME1 so much fun. That @TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life that I had ever had, because we were laughing and having the best @TIME1 ever. Laughter is an important key in my life. I would have never gotten the girl or have had the best @TIME1 of my life if laughter was never involved. Laughter makes everything better and I use it in my everyday life because everybody needs to have a good laugh if they are in a bad mood. Without laughter my life would be dull and have no color that would make me who I am today. It's one of the many keys of life that everyone needs to be happy, and without it you would be less happy then you are right now. A small child could live his whole childhood without laughter or any other important element in his life and he could end up being a mean and cruel person who does not understand good values and humor. Everybody needs personality and color in their life and with out it everything id grey. Life is like a coloring book and without someone or something to color them in with, it's just useless."	17	20		37				3	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20877	8	" I have had many great times with my grandpa. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandpa and I get together for a camping trip there is trouble coming no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along the @ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at had no open sites so we moved on to the next campground. @CAPS1 campground had tons of open campsites so we picked the best one we could find and stayed there for the first @TIME1. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campground. The reason was that there was a racoon problem a few days before and people were scared to stay in the campground for fear of attack or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the racoon and we never lost any of our food.  The next @TIME2 on the way out we saw a sign that read ""caution racoon problem."" @CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @LOCATION1, which is a small town on the @ORGANIZATION1. Once in @LOCATION1 we stopped for gas and more food to last through the @TIME1. While at the gas station we had little bit of an issue but it was very funny. A young blond woman came out to help us and she wasn't the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline than we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa is rolling up his window he mutters quite loudly ""dumb blonde"", while the woman was standing right there. She didnt say a word and my gandpa drove off with me and cousin laughing so hard we could barely breath. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said dumb blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What even made it better was that he drove off like nothing had happened. The next @TIME1 we stayed at a diiferent campground with no racoons. Still the @TIME1 was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmellows over the fire after our dinner and for some odd reason my grandpa could not keep the marshmellow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmellow before he even got one that he could eat. And everytime he dropped one into the fire it got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomach hurt. The best part was theat my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent that @TIME1 we were so tired everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in the @TIME2. Thats when everything went silent and we couldnt last any longer. We were all asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have gone camping with my grandpa every year now for about four years and each year we have an adventure filled with laughter as we go closer to each other. My grandpa is a great man and I look up to him for many things in my life. He has always keep me laughing and I try to do the same for him. He and I believe that it is important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you grow closer to whoever you are with. Keep laughing and have a fun in all you do."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20878	8	" ""Laughter"" I believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things between you and a loved one get fuzzy making them laugh will always help break the ice. When I get angry with my boyfriend he knows that in order for me to be happy he must make me smile/laugh. That is exactly what he does. The very first time he made me angry he didn't know what to do. It was @DATE1 @CAPS1 and I had just started dating. I remember he asked me if I was hungry and I said ""no I'm not hungry,"" so he continued to ask. Since we had only been dating for a short period of time he really didn't know much about me, so he didn't know that I am a type of girl that gets annoyed easily and I have a really low temper. He continued to ask me if I was hungry, thirsty, bored, or tired but he didn't realize that at this point I was really annoyed; an hour and a half passed by and he was still asking! I was going crazy I didn't want to tell him how I felt because I knew I was going to make him feel bad, but I thought to myself and said ""no he has to know because its going to be worst if later on in the relationship he has to find out what I like and don't like on his own rather that me telling him. I went on and told him every single little detail about me good and bad, at first he just listened but towards the end he exploded and told me that why wasn't I just straight up with him from the beginning. That made me really upset, I was trying to be honest with him before anything worse happened but i guess not. I stayed quiet for the longest time and he kept asking me ""what's wrong,"" ""tell me what I did wrong"" so I told him that it really made me upset how he flipped out on me for no reason really all I was trying to do was save us from a larger argument, he looked at me and told me that I did do something wrong! He said that we had already been together for two months and it took me that long to show him my true colors I kind of understood where he was coming from but at the same time I didn't agree because by that point he should have already known. I mean it doesn't take that long to know a person especially if its your girlfriend. In the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other. He busted out saying ""ouch charlie you bit me"" in a @CAPS2 accent that just made me loose it I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about thee over whelming discussion we had. The point being here is that laughter is the tool to breaking the ice when things get tough and it doesn't necessarily have to be a loved one it can even be a complete stranger, if the person is shy making them laugh will help construct a great friendship with them. You can make anybody's day go great with just a little grin that you put on their face a simple ""hello"" or ""hey"" can even make them smile. I believe that a person that smiles often lives longer. This @MONTH1 not be true but in my little world it is. I am all about smiling, all about making people laugh. Honestly I hate seeing people walk around with angry faces like if they have no friends when all they really want is someone to make them smile-and that would be me! In conclusion, if it wasn't for laughter what relationship would still be standing at this point? None, because if your always arguing and always wining and never laughing then how do you expect your relationship to last? Like I said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."""	17	18		35				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20879	8	"Angelina @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a year ago, some time in the @DATE2, I was at my best friend @PERSON1's house for a sleepover after her @CAPS3 party. We were exhausted from swimming at her @CAPS4's pool and taking her dog for a walk, not to mention the partying, and we would have been asleep if it weren't for the family-sized bag of @CAPS5 and six pack of @ORGANIZATION1 we'd consumed not an hour before. At around three in the @TIME1, our childish minds searching for something to do, we decided it was a good idea to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish in hopes of them glowing in the dark when held to the black light on her windowsill. I was the first one daring enough to touch my tongue to the brush, and boy did it hurt! The acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds. The next day was @DATE1 and, after hanging out at @LOCATION1's house for the afternoon, we came to my house for another sleepover, which is what we did and sometimes still do every time we are together. That night, this time around two in the @TIME1, we grew hungry again and came downstairs to get a snack before retreating back to my room and @PERSON1 playing on my computer while I used her phone to text my former crush. @PERSON1 got jars or ice water, I still don't know why she uses jars instead of cups, interrupted my spinning around the kitchen floor with my new socks, and we had a random instantaneous ice chugging contest. After ten seconds of silence, I glanced over my jar at @LOCATION1, who wasn't even half done with her water. There, on her chin, was a speck, a dot, a glob, of blue nail polish. I attempted a gasp to give me enough air to start laughing at her, but instead of air coming into my windpipe, and ice cube made its way in. Choking, laughing, falling on the floor, laughing, nail polish-picking, and more laughing, we stood in the middle of the kitchen with nothing to actually laugh at that was that funny. @PERSON1 dropped her jar and it shattered on the floor, sending shards of glass and water across the kitchen, but that's okay. We were having fun, and, guess what, we fell asleep on the kitchen floor not ten minutes later. I suppose we were more tired then we thought. We did clean up the glass though. Some people say laughing is the best medicine a doctor can use, that it can cure any disease, that it can brighten anyone's day. Dentist's apprentices use laughing gas that makes people loopy and smile a lot when they do operations on your teeth, and it doesn't hurt as much, until the day after, but that's because you just had a tooth pulled. Today @PERSON1 and I are still best friends. Sure, we get in fights, but they end within a week or two. The longest fight we were ever in lasted a month and a half, and it was a misunderstood rumor another friend of mine had started, and ended by us both laughing @CAPS2 how stupid whatever happened really was. Within the five or six years of @PERSON1 and I being friends, we realized laughing is healthy and good for you, both physically and emotionally to relieve stress, so every time we see each other we laugh as much as possible. Inside jokes popping up from something said that was totally unrelated, a funny-looking person walking down the side of the road, or just our own minds saying its time to be happy again, it all triggers laughter. Sometimes it hurts, but we cant help laughing harder, because its fun."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20881	8	"Once upon a time, on a late rainy night my friends @PERSON2 I decided @CAPS5 would be fun to go out in the woods @PERSON2 play @NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us out to the woods @PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us, two would go out @PERSON2 hide @PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well once while us four were doing that @CAPS5 was pouring down rain @PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two that hide were @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 the two that stayed in the car to count was me friend @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. Before @PERSON2 @PERSON2 @PERSON1 went out to hide we all made up a signal to let the others know if we were okay or no. The danger signal was @CAPS1 @CAPS1. @CAPS3 after we had our little meeting @PERSON2 got everything situated @PERSON2 dealt with, @PERSON1 got out of the car @PERSON2 went of @PERSON2 hid while me @PERSON2 @PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @PERSON2 count. After we counted to about @NUM2 we hear screaming @PERSON2 shouting. My first thought was that they just got chicken @PERSON2 maybe wanted to freak out @PERSON3 @PERSON2 I. I was curious @CAPS3 I cracked the car door open @CAPS3 I can hear a little better about what they were saying. Sure enough here came @PERSON1 @PERSON2 rite behind her was @PERSON2. @PERSON2 looked as if @CAPS4 was about to cry @PERSON2 @PERSON2 couldn't ran fast enough to get back to the car, @CAPS4 kept slipping @PERSON2 sliding everywhere all over on the road but @CAPS4 finally made @CAPS5 back @PERSON2 @PERSON1 @PERSON2 @PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We all sat there crammed in this little car thinking about what they were running @PERSON2 screaming from, @CAPS3 me being the brave one at the moment decided to go take a look at things. Of course with @PERSON2 not wanting to look or feel like wimps followed close behind me. As I was walking down the road from where I saw them run from @LOCATION1 jumps out in front of me @PERSON2 says ""right over there I swear I saw something dart across the road!"" @CAPS3 I walked over to where @CAPS4 pointed @PERSON2 looked around thinking that @ORGANIZATION1's crazy @PERSON2 @CAPS4's just seeing things. But as I walk on, @PERSON2 grabs me from the back @PERSON2 screams. I turn around @PERSON2 look at her thinking ""what the heck is wrong with you people!"". @CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @PERSON2 looks up with a very frightened expression on her face. I turn toward her @PERSON2 ask her ""whats wrong"" @CAPS4 asks me, ""why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot?!"" @CAPS5 was dark @PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @PERSON2 was freaking out about. I go back to the car to get a flash light hoping a came see what is on the tree a little bit better @PERSON2 as soon as I make my way back to @PERSON2 by the tree, @ORGANIZATION1 lets out a blood curdling scream @PERSON2 yells ""@CAPS6! Its moving, whatever @CAPS5 is @CAPS5's moving @CAPS7!"" @CAPS3 as I approach the girls @PERSON2 rips the flash light out of me hands, turns @CAPS5 on @PERSON2 points @CAPS5 to the tree. Sure enough there was a big tan spot @PERSON2 the white tree. As us girls sat the waiting for @CAPS5 to move again @CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @CAPS5 with the flash light @PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @PERSON2 get their feet under them they want to hit me because they don't know what is in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn back to @PERSON1 @PERSON2 ask her ""@CAPS3 @PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?"" @CAPS4 freaked out again asking what is was. I told her, ""take a look at @CAPS5 for yourself"" @CAPS4 looked up @PERSON2 saw @CAPS5.... A large brown paper bag that got swept up by the wind. As soon as I see that @CAPS4 say @CAPS5 I told @PERSON2 what @CAPS5 was @PERSON1 her @PERSON2 I started cracking up laughing about @PERSON1 @PERSON2 her ""hideous monster"". Once I got my laughs out on @PERSON2, we all went back to the car where @PERSON3 was waiting @PERSON2 we left. Ever since that night @PERSON2, @PERSON2 @PERSON2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Every time we think about @CAPS5 we all start laughing @PERSON2 making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag."	16	12		28				4	3	4	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	2						
20882	8	" For me laughter makes the world go round. It is much needed to keep the world light and filled with a seance of happiness. You will hardly come across me with out a big old smile plastered across my face. There is so many stores to choose from but @TIME1 one will be the most fun to tell i think. It still makes me giggle just thinking about that @TIME1. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, @PERSON1, down to @LOCATION1 for the forth of @DATE1. They have a big forth of @DATE1 walk and i was lucky to get to tag along with him and his mom. We wear staying with good friends of his mom @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. There house was stunningly amazing, beaut full wood floors, big open living room that combined with the kitchen and dining room, vaulted ceilings, and a big stunning window that framed crisp @CAPS3. @CAPS4. Even with the house being so great my favorite part wear the rail rode tracks. Not more than a quarter of a mile through a little trail surrounded with woods wear two sets of tracks stretching out in both directions @CAPS5 far @CAPS5 the eye could see. My favorite part of the hole trip wear those tracks. It was the second @TIME1 of our stay in @LOCATION1 around @NUM1 o clock. @PERSON1 and i when for a walk in the refreshing @TIME1. We could hardly see and wear holding on tight to each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and giggling we finally stumbled out of the very well hidden trail entrance on to the tracks. Hand in hand we started to walk down the tracks just enjoying each others presents. In @CAPS4 the stars are the most stunning i have ever seen. I'm not sure why but the sky just seems to open up and look two times bigger than it relay is. @TIME1 @TIME1 was perfect for star gazing with out a cloud in sight. So we decided to lay down between the tracks and look at the stars. There we cuddled together for a good @NUM2 minuets. Then @PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled expression then i followed his gaze to see what had aroused him. Far in the distance was a light. Slowly advancing t words use. Sure-a-nuff it was a train at @NUM1 o clock at @TIME1. Looking back at each other we both laughed at the pure surprise of a train at @TIME1. @CAPS5 the train advanced we jumped up and off the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could resume our spot.  The train was going way slower than i was expecting. No more than @NUM4 to @NUM5 mile per hour. @PERSON1's eyes lit up with an idea and not thinking he said ""We should jump it!""  @CAPS5 soon @CAPS5 the words left his mouth he regretted saying them. I thought it was a great idea! But he tried desperately to convince me not to do it. I headed twords the track telling him to live a little and lets have some fun. I had never jumped a train before but from the looks of it @TIME1 train was perfect to try it out on. There wear long flat bead cars with handy little latters on each one. I garbed for one and jumped on right before @PERSON1 could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We wear both smiling and having a great @TIME1 when we jumped off and met in a hug. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started coming our way. Freaking out, for sure thinking we would get in trouble i sprinted for the trail head with @PERSON1 close on my heals. I could not find the trail and the light was getting closer so we both jumped full speed straight in to a big bunch of bushes. There we stayed perfectly still tell the light passed us and the train began to rezoom its pace. I met @PERSON1's big fat smile and we both just rolled over laughing not being able to help ourselves. What wear the chances of going out for a simple walk and all @TIME1 happening. Still smiling hugely @PERSON1 leans over to me and gave me a perfect kiss. That was one of my best nights ever. @TIME1 is just an example of how smiling and laughter was a big part of @PERSON1's and I in our relationship. Love, friends, and laughter is the reason life is worth living.  "	18	20		38				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	4	5	4	5	3						
20883	8	"Being able to laugh, is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share it with is priceless. Family moments like that, are times no one can take away. They will be there for you to look back on and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and a very depressing place. Laughter is the main connection between family and friends.  My family and I decided that for our @DATE1 break we would drive to the great land of @LOCATION1. Not one of us @CAPS1 how to get there, but my mom told us she would figure it out and for us not to worry about it. So the day we were released from school my mom packed us up and off we went.After two long hours of driving we finally arrived at the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The crowd to get across was huge. On the boat to get across, I thought about going up stairs to see where we were at. There it was @LOCATION2.  Once we got off the boat and through the crowed highways of @LOCATION2, and started to make our way across the @LOCATION2/@CAPS4 border. I noticed that my mother had a weird look on her face, the look of worry. My sister asked her if she @CAPS1 what she was doing, she replied ""kinda"". After hours and hours of driving my mother thought it would be a good idea to just buy a map. When we looked at the map we noticed a little town that was very close. When we arrived my mom said we will stay here for the night. When we all woke up my mother told us that she remembered that the town we were staying in is the town we were suppose to be in. After driving around the town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room resting from driving around. My sister made a comment to my mom, about how funny it was to watch her drive around and act like she @CAPS1 what she was doing. This made all of us laugh. We all started to make random comments on her great navigation skills. The rest of the trip we drove around laughing and telling my mom, don't get lost this time, and ask for directions if you need them. laughing about us getting lost made the trip a truly unforgettable moment.   Being able to laugh, is the greatest feeling in the world. To do it with family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and dull. Being with family and taking a negative situation, and turning it into the best vacation ever with laughter is truly priceless.Everybody needs to laugh in their life,because you only live once so make it worth while."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	3	3						
20884	8	" Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together over the same thing, a special bond is made that is like no other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Every person on this @LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the bond that laughter brings. Last @DATE2, I was a member of a select lacrosse team and I didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice, I still hadn't talked to many girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I made a comment to one of the girls and she laughed. We began talking and throughout the rest of that practice, we talked and became friends. By making her laugh I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. The final practice was cut short so that the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear at the tournament. I sat down with @PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with at the previous practice, and her friend @PERSON1 came over to sit with us on the concrete. We all began talking and laughing with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to put the dye onto them. We were laughing and making a mess of the multiple colors, having a good time and enjoying the warm night. As we finished our shirts and put the sopping wet clothing into plastic bags, we walked to the parking lot and said our goodbyes. I now had two friends on the team and could not wait to leave for the tournament that @DATE1. On a @DATE1 @TIME1, I woke up at @NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @LOCATION1, OR. We were all meeting there to load our things into the three large white vans and to drive up as a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls looking tired and also sporting the tie-dyed shirts. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were in the back with another girl in between them so I sat in the row ahead of them. Some more girls from the team crammed into the van and we were on our way. During the @NUM2 @NUM3 hour car ride we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we all bonded with each other over laughter and story telling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds which made for a very entertaining car ride.  At the tournament, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I all stuck together. We walked around the fields, ate meals and laughed together almost the whole time. The only time we were apart was when roomates were assigned and we were not put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal, winning games and making it to the championship. All of the girls on that team bonded in some way and even now, most of us are still in contact with each other.  Laughter is what brought @PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The entire team bonded over laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other through laughing and having a good time. Putting @NUM4 girls together from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other by making other laugh, making it a positive experience for all involved. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience that everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships built on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter, and united together as one."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5						
20885	8	"   Humor is a huge part of who i am,and i love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousins house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while but they would always cave and let us back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our life time. It all started out at my aunts birthday party. Usually she had it at some fancy restaurant but not this year, this year she decided just to have it at home to save some money. So we all show up for my aunts party my mom, my brothers, and me. First off we do all the regular birthday things, the meeting of family members, eating some food, and singing happy birthday. Basically in my eyes it was all the boring stuff. I mean come on there was a trampoline out in the back yard just waiting to be jumped on but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had ate. Finally everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an even that was about to transpire"	15	19		34				3	3	4	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	4						
20887	8	"It was a normal day, I had just woken up, because my friend @PERSON2 who had called me wondering if I wanted to hangout.I said yes and I went and took a shower and got ready. Once I was ready I called him back and asked him where he wanted to hangout at. He told me that he wanted me to go over to kyle house and play basketball.When I got there everyone was over there so we decied to have a big game of basketball.I was on the better team and already knew we were going to win, but every single shot I took I missed and it was really embarresing, but my team ended up winning which was no suprise.After the game we all were tired and went inside to play video games. We played @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @NUM1, we took turns and on my turns I did really bad because I dont really play video games so everyone laughed at me including myself.As soon as we were done playing I got a @CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night, and wanted to know if everyone and I wanted to go.Everyone decied to go, and we all wanted to see the movie paranormal activity @NUM1, so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went over to @PERSON1 house and hungout with all the girls.We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up stairs getting ready.I was bored so I went up stairs to hangout with the girls and let me tell you it was a bad idea because the second I walked up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or let them put makeup on me.So I went back down stairs and warned everyone not to go up there.They asked why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them went up there anyway and came back with makeup on I laughed so hard that i fell off the couch.Once I finaly stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there was not enough seats in the car so me and all the girls we cramed into the front seat and the reast of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy.When we got in the movie theater there was a pretty long line but it was worth it.Suprisingly the moive was acutaly kinda scary it made me jump like five times.When we drove home it was like @NUM3 and @PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and the whole way back he was freaking out and it made me laugh and it made him laugh how I was kinda freaked out too.I think that it was a really fun day because I was laughing through most of it."	15	17		32				3	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20888	8	" @CAPS1 is my personal belief that that hilarity and giddiness are the best emotional states to be in. Therefore @CAPS1 makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things would be of good relations. @CAPS1 is because of their likeness of minds that they are connected and find happiness in each others company. My story is an example of laughter's connection between people and the strength of the bond @CAPS1 forms. Picture the scene: @CAPS1 was @DATE2 on the north side of @CAPS2. Hood below the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he could not continue further. Patiently standing beside him was his father, a climbing veteran who had scaled mountains in @LOCATION1,and @LOCATION2. The boy was tired, he could not put one foot in front of the other. His muscles screamed in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The @DATE1 sun beat down on him while the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. @CAPS1 was as if the mountain wanted him to fail and was urging him to give in and cry in defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had dimmed as well leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like putting on foot in front of the other. He began finding any excuse to stop and made them often. The boy's father had tried everything he could think of to give his son the incentive to keep going with no avail. He tried another tack, he began to tell the boy stories, perhaps in hope that @CAPS1 would take the boy's mind of the excruciating pain.And to the relief of all concerned, @CAPS1 proved effective. What was most interesting about the whole event is @CAPS1 wasn't the content of the stories that helped, @CAPS1 was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference.An infusion that I would describe as a solution of laughing gas and an energy drink washed over me. In the presence of my father's humor I found the strength to keep going . @CAPS1 was like I had been completely recharged and refreshed. My arms and leg which had previously felt like solid pipes of lead lightened considerably. The stabbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed away and left. The dull pulsing of the blisters on my heels were silenced. This was all due to someones thoughts and ideas tickling my funny bone. I believe laughter to be the anesthetic of nature,the emotional element that keeps the world sane. @CAPS1 was at that point in time when I realized what I respected most about my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had a indomitable work ethic, was a great teacher, and possessed an extraordinary amount of energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found hilarity at each others comment's. @CAPS1 forged a strong bond between us, one constructed of euphoria and glee that continues to this day. Whenever I am morose he always manages to find away to bring a smile to my face and I found that I to had the same ability. To my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way to friendship,respect,and love. You cannot have hope for a better future if you do not have laughter. @CAPS1 is the drug that descends from the heavens. A drug that runs through the bloodstream of society. In the process freeing the minds from the stress and worries of what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a feeling of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned to find that at the exact same moment someone across the room had also began to laugh. Then your eyes lock and a slow smile spread's throughout both of your faces, as you realize that you are not alone in how you think and what you laugh at. That connective force is a result of the power of laughter."	19	25	50	50				4	3	4	3	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5	5
20889	8	" Laughing, smirking, giggling, @CAPS1 chuckling; these all have to do with one subject, @CAPS1 that is, laughing. Laughter is everywhere, you hear it in libraries, parks, at home, behind your back, @CAPS1 it can be a great thing or a horrible thing in @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 even with family @CAPS1 friends. Everyone has a past with laughing that has welcomed them, helped them out, cheered them up, or even, just so they can make a very special friend that will stay with them forever. It was the start of a brand new @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 I had just moved from @LOCATION2. I was a seventh grader about to start at @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wasn't a real big fan of hanging out with people , so i stayed to myself most of the weeks, eating lunch in the guidance center, trying to figure out where books where without talking to anybody. My schedule was good, I had choir, art, drama, you know all the stuff I like. Art @CAPS1 drama were a blast, but when it came to choir @CAPS1 singing, my social level went down. I love to sing, but never did it in front of people. Then one day, I was walking to choir @CAPS1 I tripped @CAPS1 fell, my papers falling with me. My @ORGANIZATION1 work was all over the hall, math at one end, science at the other. But, out of all the kids in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked by @CAPS1 say I did a great job but something triggered her to come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework @CAPS1 picked up my schedule @CAPS1 saw that she too had choir this period. Her name was @PERSON1, she told me, @CAPS1 i told her my name, @CAPS1 we walked together. We sat next to each other @CAPS1 i sang with her ours voices in harmony. We talked in between periods, at lunch, on the bus ride home. We became great friends @CAPS1 the principal thought so too @CAPS1 he went ahead @CAPS1 gave us classes together. We were friends @CAPS1 we still are friends till this day. But the sad thing is is that she moved at the near end of eighth grade year. But she was the only friend I had for a little while @CAPS1 I always give her a call every now @CAPS1 then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing @CAPS1 talking about how we are doing @CAPS1 when we are going to see each other again. She has been my best friend for at least two years now @CAPS1 it all happened by a slip of a foot, that falling of papers, @CAPS1 one little laugh from an amazing person. Laughing has got me so far in life @CAPS1 at @ORGANIZATION1. Every now @CAPS1 then, when i see someone, all alone, wanting a friend, I go @CAPS1 talk to them, @CAPS1 even laugh with them. One little laugh can trigger a huge friendship waiting to happen. Even if you don't think so, it does. Some say, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 I believe who ever said that because it happened to me."	20	19	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20892	8	"  When it comes down to laughter, it can change a person's thinking or even the mood that @CAPS4 are in. Laughter can be the ending result, to a bad start to a day or to greater the relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I am feeling and it keeps me happy, I not only laugh when I'm sad, but also when I'm in a great mood as well. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and war, I feel like you should always keep your head held high and the smiles flowing. Although, when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade and keep your face with the sour look because it's funny! I think that laughter is one of the best medicines around and can fix most problems whenever you are feeling down.  @CAPS2 older sister brought into this world the most amazing little nieces, an aunt could ever have. When @CAPS4 were little babies I used make silly faces, dance to @PERSON1 and watch movies with them, but this isn't what brought us closer. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, in which made them happy too. One time, I was feeling really down and out, but I didn't want that to affect me, so I preceeded with @CAPS2 day and began to watch music videos, when ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3"", by @ORGANIZATION1 came on. @CAPS4 went crazy!, @CAPS4 started jumping on the bed and twirling their @CAPS3 back and forth as if @CAPS4 were @ORGANIZATION1!, @CAPS4 really stole the show. I couldn't believe before @CAPS2 eyes that this one happening, and I bursted out with so much joy. I felt so much of their joy, that I had to get up and dance with them, we jumped, we twirled, and whipped our @CAPS3 several times before the song ended with us dizzy and out of breath. After we had our fun of the music video, @CAPS4 just kept dancing and in @CAPS2 head I'm, like ""don't @CAPS4 ever get tired"", but I was pretty sure that their laughter brought them continouis amazement. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless, @CAPS2 nieces really and are truly what brought me up that day. It was bitter in the start but then ended up sweet, lets just called it bittersweet. I feel like @CAPS2 nieces knew that I would be sad so @CAPS4 would say ""@CAPS5, what's wrong"", @CAPS5 being @CAPS2 nickname because I am very short. @CAPS4 would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. Me and @CAPS2 neices relationship has grown to the highest extent and I know that whenever I'm with them, I will laugh. If someone once said that ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", then @CAPS4 are correct because I @MONTH1 be in a different country, state or any other area but whether we talk on the phone or actually see each other, I will laugh about all their crazy antics and the closer we become as one.

20893	8	" Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you @MONTH1 be one person who can be ""stuck up"" or a funny person who can really be ""stuck up"", but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are. When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. ""@CAPS1 are blue, roses are red, your always in my head, i want you in my bed...."" That's suppose to be a love poem. When your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend that went with me to the party her name is @PERSON1. It was gettting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything this was probably around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. See us for some reason do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just didn't want the night to end at all.  We al sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching ""@CAPS2 A"". Then out of random i started to laugh at @LOCATION1, and till this day I don't know why i was laughing at her. All of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe no more. So I got up walk my self to the bathroom, but i could still hear @CAPS3 laughter in the room which was still making me laugh.  Since that night @PERSON1 and I got a lot closer in our friendship. Laughter is a lot in life. It might make you feel like your dying sometimes, but that feeling is worth it."	17	20		37				3	4	3	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20894	8	" As we all know, water is what we most need to stay alive cause without it we'd pretty much die. Well, it's also quit similar with laughter. I once heard my night school teacher say, ""@CAPS1 is @PERCENT1 attitude"". I thought about it for r a moment and realized it's quit true. No one can really go throughout the hole day, without having any type of beverage and as much as someone is upset for any apparel reason, will soon end up smiling. Who knows perhaps for the silliest thing whatsoever. I've been going out with my boyfriend @LOCATION1, for about seven months already. We don't get to see each other as much as I'd like to. We try to spend the weekends together as much as we can, but there's been times when it's every other weekend. Since him and I have quit a few things in common like, our relatives, knowing each other before dating, places we go for entertainment, food, likes and dislikes. We rarely dislike of where we'll be spending our time togethe or what we're doing. Even though its been about seven months since we've been dating, it feels like we've known each other way before we became friends. Once when I was over at @LOCATION1's house celebrating @PERSON2's birthday, @ORGANIZATION1's youngest sister. We, all who where there, were celebrating her birthday with pinatas, cake, and all she wanted, witch where toys too. We where all having a good time but the kids weren't so much, it seemed as if they were running out of energy since they were playing in the trampoline for quit a couple of hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already gotten most of what was need to set up the pinatas. As they heard the candy being pored into the pinatas they all rush to get there first before the others, could get to hit the pinata. @PERSON2 go to hit the pinata before all the others, since it was her birthday, then the little kids followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, of pretending to imagine who the pinata was representing. As time passed, it was turn for the older kids to go up and hit the pinata. Most of us were kind of shy, but before I notice a @NUM1 year-old went up to hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata quit hard the others said her time was up, they were anctious to get the candy out. After her turm was over she was supose to call out on someone. I thought she would end up calling me since she keept looking towards me. I was already blushing, good thing she didnt. she ended up calling out on my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabed the stick to hit the pinata. Once he got there, the others where said to not hit it so hard or else the little ones whouldn't like him anymore. Since he is one of thoes persons who's love @CAPS3 everyone. He cheard me up to go with him. Without him saying that ii don't think I would of done it. Right there were we where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it to hard that I ended up hitting him. Before @CAPS2 even say anything, one of his aunts said. That's the way I'd be getting when ever I'd get bothered at him. @CAPS3 starting out slow then hitting him right where it hurt the most. I was even reder then when I was blising, all I thought of saying was that it might be true when ever it happend @CAPS3 then @PERSON1' mom was already getting the cake out, I just left fron where I was at to go help her out. Once we all got settled to sing happy birth-day to @LOCATION2, we where stil laughing of what had happen. Thing is they where stil talking about it. How it might be the same when we get merried. Again I didnt know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and right before I could call my dad he was already outside the door. All I said was thank you daddy,with a silly smile."	18	18		36				4	4	4	3	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20895	8	" Just @CAPS1 walking through @ORGANIZATION2 in a banana costume with one of your best friends. We were trying to find the best costumes for a @CAPS2 party. When having so much fun by taking many pictures and videos we lost track of time. I can't even remember which one of us was laughing the hardest. @CAPS3 is just one example of the crazy things my friend @PERSON1 and I have done together. One thing is for certain, whenever we are together we are always laughing. Laughter reduces stress for both @PERSON1 and I. We were team members for the past six years. Both of us competed as gymnasts at @ORGANIZATION1. We worked out at the gym @DATE1 for four hours each day. That gave us no time to hang out with friends and just enough time to do homework. At @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 and I needed to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. @CAPS3 meant off the floor we needed laughter to reduce stress, as well as fear. In order to do that we would hang out a lot on the weekends and in the @DATE2 sun.  Our friendship was strong because of all the laughing and fun times together. When either of us became stressed we would make the other cheer up by remembering the times when we laughed our heads off. Even when we are not together we often think of the memories we have shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps to reduce fear. It helps because if you were not having fun and laughing you would think about all of the bad things at could happen to you; then would you do have laughter involved it makes you want to do whatever it would be with your friend.  The laughter @PERSON1 and I shared always attached others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join is because we were having such a great time together. For example, @DATE2 we were at @LOCATION1's house and we were playing outside on a warm, sunny day. We were laughing and all of a sudden one of her neighbors shows up. After one came, more and more kids and her friends came, after awhile it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a big group of people, @PERSON1 and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It usually was a hide and go seek tagging game. Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were always laughing because we would trick everyone that was playing. It created a good and positive bond for the two of us even though there were more people. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS3 is how @PERSON1 and I became such amazing friends today. Without laughter, I do not think we would have been as close of friends if we didn't have laughter in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer together every single time we see each other. Laughter really connects the bond between friends and its helps both of you get through hard times."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20896	8	" ""Many other people believe that laughter is an important of any relationship."" Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with those thoughts.  I came to @LOCATION1 about @DATE1, I did not speak @CAPS1 at all that time. I started going school. I practiced saying my name, age, and where I came from before I go to school. Next day I walked in to school and I could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary to me. I looked back at one girl and she walked towards me.  ""@CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1,"" the girl said. ""@CAPS2, my name is @CAPS4. I'm from @LOCATION2. I don't really speak @CAPS1,"" I said to @PERSON1, then @PERSON1 started laughing so hard. ""@CAPS6-@CAPS6 you have accent,"" @PERSON1 said, ""it's really cute."" I laughed back. @PERSON1 looked really nice with her smiles on and we became friends so quickly. She was my first @CAPS7 friend ever.  I always thought that making new friends are hard, but the laughter made it much easier than it used to be."	15	15		30				3	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	3						
20897	8	" Laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny. It is the best way to relax. Everyone says that hearing a baby laugh is great. Watching comedians doing their acts can cheer people up and have them start laughing. Laughter is the best way to relax and here is three reason for that. First, is that no one can stay angry at the person making them laugh. Second, is that when someone laughs everyone around that person start laughing. Third and last reason, is that no one can stay sadden when something funny is happening. What do you think when you hear a baby's laughter? I think that the baby is truly loved by its family. He or she is having a bast playing with someone in the family or themselves. They think that whatever you are doing is funny. A comedian's job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them. One way a comedian does an act is stand up comedy. That is when a comedian is on stage and does his or her act. Another way is a comedy. A comedy can be a @CAPS1.V. show, a play, or a movie. Comedies usually do not have a plot, but the point is to make you and anyone else start laughing. That is what I think about laughter. It helps anyone relax. Hearing a baby's laugh is great. Comedians love hear people laugh at or with them."	17	15		32				3	3	4	4	3	4	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20898	8	" @CAPS6 only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying on his chair with his hands over his eyes, a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to start off with. The guy's head rose up, the tears seemed to eat the self sturdiness of his normal self, and @CAPS2 spoke to the person who always sat to his left. "" @CAPS1 just don't understand @PERSON2"" the broken, voice cracked on words ""I don't care that @CAPS1 play in cascade winds or that @CAPS1 get private lessons or that @CAPS1've gone to state honor band! This @MONTH1 sound like a terrible reason, but i just want to play first because i want to play first, and @CAPS1 never let us play first."" @CAPS2 was right about one thing, @PERSON2 really never let us play first. I somehow understood where @CAPS3 was coming from; @CAPS4 my freshman year i had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so forth. I had never seen him be first chair on anything. And now on his senior year, a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair. In short @CAPS3's four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room. The feeling of all his hard work turned into mediocre in his face, with time, had broken him to tears.  @PERSON2 was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove @CAPS6. She had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and would be going to @LOCATION1 as an ambassador of music. Still something about her having first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe @CAPS6 was my sense of wanting superiority as well. @PERSON2 took in the words, leaned closer to say. "" I understand that @CAPS1 want first"" @CAPS10 with confident tones she said ""but right now we need specific players in specific spots. I've played harder music and my skills are whats needed on first part. I understand what your feeling, ive been there before.""  @CAPS6 struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior. How could she have felt what @CAPS2 was feeling? she'd been a prodigy child in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 from the start. I sided with @PERSON1 but @CAPS10 I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band. So i tried siding with @PERSON2 but @CAPS10 all i could think about was that this was @PERSON1's last year to shine as a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 french horn player.They kept going at eachother. Every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument. Minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile.  I had to think faster. @CAPS9 the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co-operation would be useless. More importantly I would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts. ""@CAPS9 a man has no socks,"" I liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, "" @CAPS10 so will..."".And that's as far as i got. I thought @CAPS6 was brilliant, their faces said otherwise. So they called me crazy and giggled @CAPS10 they made fun of me and laughed. Thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say. @CAPS3 stopped crying, finally, and @PERSON2 got my message that @CAPS3 was a senior and didn't really have many more chances at playing first chair in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 band. They settled the fight with a simple deal; @CAPS3 would get fist chair as soon as we stopped competing. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 I've been the center of being made fun of. But as annoying as @CAPS6 gets sometimes its usually funny for everyone, including myself.  I cant even begin to imagine what band would be like @CAPS9 their enmity had risen to the no forgiveness zone. There had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so @CAPS7 @CAPS6 made @CAPS6 hard to breath right. Having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip eachother's faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other. Or opened their eyes to how long they're going to have to sit next to each other i they were to continue fighing. Either way, @CAPS6's definatley changed the way they feel about eachother; I haven't heard them complian about one another for a while. @CAPS3 is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and @PERSON2 for better or worse can't wait to see him play."	23	21		44				5	5	5	5	5	4	5	4	5	4	4	4						
20899	8	"We're happy together @PERSON1 told me @CAPS2 we lay on his bed. I just smiled and I knew this was going to be a really good relationship. @CAPS5 always made me feel so great. @CAPS5 made me feel beautiful. Now don't say your too young to know what love is ,@CAPS1 I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know that no one has ever made me feel this wonderful about myself, made me feel perfect. When we are together it's fun. Most guys I have been with have not been @CAPS2 fun, @CAPS2 in our dates together, walking to the park too sit and talk, eating out to kiss in public. Before we were ever dating, We were best friends. We still are best friends. Everyone asked us @CAPS6 we were dating, The answer was always no we're best friend's, but I always wanted more. @CAPS5 has always made me laugh. I don't think we would have made such a strong couple @CAPS6 we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about @CAPS4 I first knew I loved him makes me laugh. I was walking to my @DATE1 class, and out of no where @PERSON1 grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buried his head in my neck and laughed and said ""@CAPS3, you have some toilet paper sticking out of your pants"" I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and quietly asked him to hide me so I could grab it. When I got to my @DATE1 class I was thinking to myself @CAPS4 could @CAPS5 just say that to me, @CAPS5 must of wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what @CAPS5 did and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 did it made me feel, well it made me feel like @CAPS5 really and truly cared about me. Wanting to help me out rather then embarrass me. I bet every other guy was laughing. Not @PERSON1... well after that happened we had a good laugh. After we laughed and joked about what happened to me, @CAPS5 looked up and kissed me. I didn't know @CAPS6 that was a best friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I simply laughed. then @CAPS5 kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real love kiss. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out the more people started to hate the fact that we were together. They would say some horrible things to me in the hallway about @PERSON1. Who knows what they were telling him. @CAPS7 some of my closest friends started to make rude comments toward me and @PERSON1. I know @CAPS5 didn't believe anything they were saying @CAPS1 @CAPS5 would laugh at everything people would toss our way. When @CAPS5 laughed I would always ask him whats so funny, @CAPS5 would say ""@CAPS6 they rumors aren't true then laugh about them, that way people will know your not bother by them"" I would have never thought about that. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would get a little peeved with all the stuff they were saying about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people were saying,. They stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought about being in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 let alone @ORGANIZATION1, and finding a guy that would understand what I'm going through. Let alone someone who is going through something almost @CAPS2 difficult. My brother went to prison @DATE1, and I don't think I could have be able to make it through @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 I did with @PERSON1. I cried almost everyday at @ORGANIZATION1 with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go see my brother I remember what @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS6 your happy the people around will be happy"" so I always put on a smile to see @LOCATION1, @CAPS7 though I know this will be the hardest years of my life. Laughing does really help. @CAPS7 @CAPS6 nothing is funny just laugh. God put you on this @LOCATION2 for a reason, and @CAPS6 you haven't found that reason laugh until you do. @CAPS1 the people in your life mean the world to you, and @CAPS6 they're down bring them up. I love @PERSON1 for helping me understand that life's to short to go unhappy then to have had a life without laughter."	17	20		37				4	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20900	8	" Everyone loves to laugh; I don't think everyone understands the effect laughter can have on two people though. For example, there can be two complete strangers, who have never seen each other before in their life; as soon as they start laughing they could become good friends. You'll never know how close you can be with someone if you don't ever sit down and talk, laugh, and get to know them. You could go your whole life being at @CAPS4 with just a minute amount of friends but then there could be @NUM1 other classmates you've never talked to that could also become your friends, too. I'm sure just getting to know one another would make a difference in someones life because for me there has been many situations where laughing has made an impact on my relationship with someone; especially with my best friend, @PERSON1. When I first met my friend @PERSON1 we didn't know each other at all but laughing broke the ice. A simple laugh made us comfortable and everything was less awkward. As soon as we started laughing more and more, we couldn't stop; the rest was history. I went to elementary @CAPS4 with @PERSON1 for @NUM2 years and never talked to her but then when we got into @NUM3 grade we started hanging out with the same people and started talking more. By @NUM4 grade we began to hang out outside of @CAPS4 and talking, sharing secrets, and having sleep overs. But ""breaking the ice"" isn't the only impact laughing can have on a relationship. When I'm with @PERSON1, I know I can trust her and everything is fun. We always have conversations to talk and laugh about. You could say it made us closer. By the time @NUM5 grade came we were best friends, we had sleepovers every single weekend at one anothers house. When the @DATE1 before our @NUM6 grade year at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 came we were spending weeks at each others houses. There wasn't a day that went by that we weren't together, talking, or making plans over the @DATE1 to hang out. Now, we can be ourselves around each other; we can always have a good time. Making people closer is just a small part of the effects that just one laugh can do to two people. When I'm sad about something @PERSON1 makes everything better; also vise versa; I make her feel better, too. We always have each others back. I know we will always be there for each other; I'll always have a shoulder to cry on. We have become such close friends that when @PERSON1 was having problems at home she needed a place to live in order for her to not have to go to The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, so she moved in with me! It has been the most fun living with her. We thought we would start to argue and not be as close since we would always be together and probably get annoyed of each other but we haven't. @PERSON1 and I can hang out @NUM7 and always be together; it's like having another sister.  @PERSON1 and I are super close, and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 until we graduate. It's amazing to think us being best friends and tremendously close, living together, always being together, and being totally comfortable with each other on everything just started out with a simple laugh when we first started talking in the @NUM3 grade. This is why I believe that just laughing can make two strangers, that have never even spoken, can turn into being the closest of friends."	22	20		42				4	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20901	8	" One @DATE1 @TIME1 back in @DATE2 a couple of friends and I were beyond bored. Nothing seemed fun to do. @CAPS1 to a movie, @CAPS1 to get some food, not even call of @CAPS2 sounded entertaining. @LOCATION1 parents told us to go do something outside. Before leaving his house he slips into his pantry and grabs two hefty rolls of @CAPS11 wrap. ""I think I have an idea"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1 as we walk away from his house. I have no clue where we're walking to. @PERSON1 just keeps saying ""follow me."" We all follow in a pack down the street until we show up at @ORGANIZATION1.   Cold and confused, we sit in the parking lot of the @ORGANIZATION1 waiting for all cars to be gone. Once all the cars are gone @PERSON1 informs us on what we are doing here. He tells us of something he did with his cousins awhile back. You have three people on the roof of @ORGANIZATION1's @ORGANIZATION1 scoping out the road and you have four @CAPS4. ""@CAPS4?"" I question @PERSON1 with a dumb-found look on my face. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS4"" @CAPS6 @CAPS4 are the people who will be putting the @CAPS11 wrap across the street. The plan is when no cars are coming in the distance, we hop the fence and put @CAPS11 wrap across the street so cars drive through it and stop. ""@CAPS7 sounds fun, but uh what happens when the @CAPS15 stops before the @CAPS11 wrap and takes it down?"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9, looking down on the whole operation.  @PERSON1 laughs a little bit and @CAPS8 ""@CAPS10 then it will be an inconvenience for the driver."" @CAPS11 wrapping roadways sounded a lot for fun then black ops so we were all down.  Everyone gets in position. Mark, @PERSON4, @PERSON2 and myself are down by the roadway in a secluded area by some bushes. While @PERSON1, @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 are posted up on the roof giving us updates about the oncoming traffic. We get a call from @CAPS9 saying that it is clear for awhile. I hang up the phone, tell the guys and @DATE3 up from the ground. We all get over the fence in quick time and start a first layer of @CAPS11 wrap. I get another call. It's @CAPS14 saying that there are three cars are almost to our location. We drop the @CAPS11 wrap in the bush and get back over the fence. The @CAPS15 comes up close and it's a cop. Of course. We all just stay hidden down in the bushes while the cop takes our huge roll of wrap. We are only left with one more roll , which should before enough.  @CAPS9 calls again and @CAPS8 it's clear. We go out again and start to set up the prank. We wrap it around @NUM1 times and make it as tight as it possibly could be. Perfect.  ""@CAPS15 incoming! Go! Go! Go!"" yells mark while trying to get over the fence. We all make it over in time and go prone in the field. Laying there anxiously someone whispers ""here it comes.""  The @CAPS15 slams on it's breaks, and the driver gets out. He looks at @CAPS11 wrap in disgust and looks around for the kids responsible. @CAPS9 lets out a big ""hahaha"" from the roof that even we can hear perfectly. The guy walks up the fence looks around a bit more and mutters for foul words under his breath. He didn't even bother continuing through, he just got in his @CAPS15 and backed up.""@CAPS16 my god dude that was hilarious!"" I say with a wide grin on my @NUM2 @CAPS9 and @PERSON3 come dashing through the field with a scared expression on all of their faces.""@CAPS18!"" yells @CAPS19 scurried into different directions. Mark, @PERSON2 and I jolt over the fence and hide in the play structure for awhile. While the rest of the boys are booking it to a safe haven. We eventually all meet back up at @LOCATION1 house without getting ""caught"" by the authorities.  It's nights like @CAPS6 were laughter really plays a key role between a big group of friends like I have. The laughing and running makes us closer as a group. it brings us together."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20902	8	" I agree when people say laughter is what mostly brings people together. In my opinion, @NUM1 of the time your talking to someone, laughter is needed. It is what brings the dullness out of a person, and makes the conversation interesting. Only when you are talking about something serious, you dont need to include laughter, but ill explain later. So I can easily tell a true story about laughter from my life. Right now i have a perfect group of friends. Sure there are times when they mess up and act like kids, but i feel like i need to forgive and remember that they are there when i need them. Anyways, i can remember the first time i met each one of them, and the one thing that started our friendship was a joke. I can't exactly remember which joke we shared, but i do remember that we all had the same taste in comedy. And once we saw that neither of us were serious and dull people, made us want to spend more time with eachother. That is why laughter builds a string between different people, and brings them closer together day by day. So as time passed, my friends and i were really drawn to eachother. What i mean is that, from time to time, we were happy to express our friendship through jokes. Sometimes the jokes are really stupid. Many of them have caused pain - physically, and have caused us to bring revenge on eachother. But that is just how, we stay close to eachother. Day by day, when we see something funny on the television, internet, or real life, we always show it to eachother, and know that after showing this prank, or whatever it is, the other person will find it very funny. It makes us feel closer, and know we all have a same taste in atleast one field. I can give one clear example of this: I was watching a comedy once, and the comedian was talking about his childhood, and a prank he once played on a strangers house. Right when i saw this video, i knew right away, my friends had to see this, because i knew from past experiences, that they enjoy these types of laughs. And i was right, as soon as they saw the show, they were amazed at how funny it was, and they were glad i shared it with them, we got closer than ever. I want to share one more example from my life, about laughter bringing two people closer. So after telling you that laughter gets me closer with friends, i also want to point out that laughter brings out a sence of outline when if you talk to girls - or boys, if you're a female. So i met this one girl, and everytime i talked to her, everytime i had to throw in a joke or a story that would make sence to our subject. After a while, she started joking around, and making stories too. She told me that she saw me as a different guy, comparing me to other people. She said that she meant i wasnt a boring type of person, and that it kept her wanting to keep talking to me. I always hoped not to be a dull person, and jokes made that not happen. Now, me and this girl are closer than ever, and the root that started this relationship was laughter. So as you see, laughter makes any relationship happy and open. Of course im talking about the relationships that are playful, i meant there are people out there that take everything serious, and can't take a joke. But i would really encourage you to take laughter in your life, if you already havent. Look in my life, i used laughter, and gained a lot of friends, of all sorts - just by joking around about something stupid. You don't have to say stupid things, but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you use laughter."	20	18	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
20904	8	" These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS1 all started in the @DATE1 time when i was like @NUM1 years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS3 cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. @CAPS1 was fun having them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and my cousin @PERSON3 who lived right next to @CAPS3 would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS3 and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS1 was his. @CAPS3 and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON4 @CAPS1 was a @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS1 was just dirt but @CAPS1 was hard. One day when @CAPS1 was raining so hard @CAPS3 , @PERSON7 , @PERSON3 and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS1 was okay same with @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he could not cause @CAPS1 was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS3 straight to the shower . @CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON5 bros for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION1, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS1 was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS3 my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 would always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards back then every body had @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM2 grade @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON6 had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept over at @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 cause they would always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family.

20905	8	" Someone once said laughter was the best medicine. To me it was like someone was saying ""@CAPS1! Life isn't gonna get any better so just enjoy it while you @CAPS6!"" @CAPS2 that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say I still laugh at most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think that if I do then everything will just get better. That's not even close to what really happens. In fact it @CAPS6 only cause more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time where I met this guy named @PERSON1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. That's how I saw it and that's how he saw it too. When we first started talking to each other it was between notes I would give my friend @CAPS3 and @CAPS8 would give them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never wrote back on a piece of paper. Instead he had @CAPS3 tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to wright messages in her phone and then I would read them and answer back. it was fun for a while but I wanted to actually meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare pictures and it was true he was very handsome but nothing like a god. He didn't have a wreath over his head with one of those @CAPS5 god skirts. Nope, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world.  Signs were going off in my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @PERSON2 (my friend) starts text messaging someone. I was a little curious so I asked in a friendly way who it was. @CAPS8 said it was @PERSON1 and my heart seemed to jump. ""@CAPS6 you tell him I say hello?"" ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS8 told him I said hello and he asked if I was really there and @PERSON2 said yes. That's when we actually got to talk to each other more than once a day. We talked all the way back to @LOCATION1. A few months went by and we were back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very kind and never did he have a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little strange, but I don't judge), his life, his future, what he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another of @CAPS3's friends said the same thing but @CAPS8 said he wasn't aloud to). I talked to him about all of it and it was like we understood each other a little bit. I told him about my life but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been bromidic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, that is until he moved to @LOCATION2. I was a little upset but it really didn't bother me except the fact that talking to each other became almost as rare as seeing a different picture of him.  While at school one morning @PERSON2 came over to me and had a careful gaze. I asked what was wrong and then @CAPS8 asked if anything could ruin my day. I told her that only going home would and we laughed a little about it. I knew something was wrong and that it had to do with @PERSON1 but I just acted oblivious to it hoping it would lessen the blow I knew was about to come. @CAPS8 said he had told her it wasn't going to work out between him and I. I sat there and like the idiot I was I said I knew it wasn't going to anyways, he was him and I was me. @CAPS8 said he was sorry and all these other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead I ignored it and went on with my life like I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @PERSON2 out but I let it go just as @CAPS8 did when @CAPS8 said no to him and they stopped talking to each other. So who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously hadn't experienced the after effects of it all. "	15	19		34				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	4	4						
20906	8	"Trust is a huge deal between friends. Friends agree on the same things, say an honest opinion about it, and don't lose the trust between a great friendship. You never know who can stay by you with a full amount of trust between you two.When you trust a friend you depend on them to keep things between each other. Just like my friends and I. We agreed on telling each other everything that has happened and not to lie about anything. We agreed on everything based on trust. Our friendship has always been great with not lying to each other. Telling each other how we feel about certain things. Then we put all our opinions together and come up with a solution that we all agree on. That's why you should depend each other like a team. When you break a trust between a friend, you probably won't get the same trust you had before. You don't really get told anything as much as you use to. An it's like you never should have lost the trust with a friend. You don't seem to be the same because you aren't trusted that much. You get told it was your fault lying or for any reason to be not trusted. Like this one time one of friends didn't tell me the whole truth of what she was doing behind my back. Till I found out what she was doing I lost most of my trust with her. She's not trusted as much she was before, but we are still friends.That's why having trust is a big deal in a friendship or any kind of relationship. You learn to trust each other in different ways, get to know each other more by having the trust between you and other person. You get a lot more attention when you have that trust with other people. You don't seem like you are left out on anything. You see that you can trust more people to when you get to know them. Who knows that you have trust for another person who isn't your best friend.So we all know that trust is a huge deal between two people or maybe even more. You need to work together for the trust. Have a good friendship or relationship to anybody as long as there is trust between you guys. My friends and I have learned a lot from trusting each other in different ways."	24	20		44				5	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4

I had grabbed all of my gear from the storage from under the bus @PERSON1 headed for the slopes. we strapped in our boots @PERSON1 went to the lift to catch a chair up. I was with my friends @PERSON1, @PERSON1 all three of us joined the snowboard team at school that year. The three of us caught a chair up to the top of the run. The air was so crisp, @PERSON1 the snow was a fresh blanket of powder. We were all so excited to go ride in that perfect of a @TIME1. As we went down the run, it was the same old usual every @DATE1 @TIME1. so I talked to my friends @PERSON1 suggested that it was time we went through some new trails. They agreed, so we went down through @TIME1 new area. It was a good trail with many jumps @PERSON1 a lot of powder. It seemed like a perfect area to board in. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized that it was coming to the end when the trail was getting a little narrow, then suddenly, there was a drop right in front of us. I shifted my board sideways so I can stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that i hit, @PERSON1 it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell off, @PERSON1 braced for impact. I was thinking that I was about to be seriously injured because of the rocks below. But luckily, my board was the first to hit the rock, showering the cool @TIME1 with sparks lighting it up. I slid down the snow a couple more feet, trying to stop myself. As I came to a stop, I looked back wondering how I survived that. I was worried that my friends would do the same, but they had stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe on what just happened. I learned a lesson from @TIME1 of to always scope out the area first before you go through it.

20909	8	" Laughter, everyone from babies to old people do it. Laughter is an element that helps in life. They say that ""laughter is the best medicine"" it truly is. Laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose. In any friendship, relationship, job or sport you need to laugh every once in a while. You can't always be serious. Being serious @NUM1 as they say is not good, it makes people seem like they don't know how to enjoy life or they have no sense of humor.  In the @DATE1 I had a rough volleyball season. A lot of my teammates had problems with me, because I was chosen as captain along side my friend @PERSON1. We weren't the most well liked, but we were liked by some. It was hard for @PERSON1 and I to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they did not want to deal with @PERSON1 and I being captains, but as they quit we moved people from junior varsity up to varsity. The new varsity members had it rough, they struggled a bit trying to get the hang, but they did it they managed to get the hang of how varsity plays and practices. Soon after our mishap of having to replace seven out of fourteen players we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest we had the whole season. In our first set of the we didn't exactly have our minds in it for the first of what would be come a five set, game. We battled back and forth a few points in the first set, but we ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do whether to give up or half-@CAPS1 it was tough, I as one of the captains said ""@CAPS1, we won't get anywhere unless we @CAPS1."" then @PERSON1 says ""I agree, lets @CAPS1 our best and not let them get an easy win."" We did exactly that we tried and we won that second set. It was the third set and we had started to get tired and feel aggravated, so we pushed forward we won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the court and the ball was served we let the ball hit the ground point one to the other team. After that first point it went down hill we let them get the best of us and they won the set. It had come down to the fifth and final set were we would either win or lose. We got on the court knowing that we might lose and started. The first point went to us we went back and forth a ton in the final set. It was a tough battle, but we had done it we won. Later in the season we met the team again and it was a hands down battle we had lost the second time we met them it was not easy at all they didn't allow any room for errors on their behalf, but us we let it all slip. It was time for the state playoffs we had made it to the state finals. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one. The line-up was called, national anthem sang, and the coin was flipped, we would receive the serve. The game was in full swing, we were doing great we won the first set by four a tough first game. We went into set two, we lost control. We didn't do what we were suppose to do. We lost the second set it was and confidence hitter. We were down we didn't know what to expect in set three, and as captains the team seeing @PERSON1 and I should have not let ourselves be down. We looked at each other with that look I knew and we just busted out laughing we couldn't stop the team wondered what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win we had to laugh we @MONTH1 feel down, but you have to laugh and the team did we went into the third set confident as ever and we won we didn't stop there we went into the fourth set and won. We had done what we set out to do win! In the end laughing was what we needed to do we had come this far that we could either give up or push and succeed. We looked at the two previous games that we had met the other team before and laughed. We made that our team motto ""laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh"" the season was great looking back on it we were state champs. Now in @DATE2 season we are hoping to repeat state champs."	17	17		34				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20910	8	" Laughter is a major component in a relationship. Laughter once saved my best freinds relationship with his girlfreind. They had just goten ito the bigest fight I have ever seen. The fight started over something so small and insignificant that neither of them could remember what it was. The fight had a snowball affect untill neither of them knew what they were fighting over. Then one day, while they were taking a break from fighting, we went to see a funny movie. A while into the movie I got up to go to the restroom, and when i got back my freind and his girlfreind were both lauphng histaricly. I asked them what was so funny, but they wouldn't tell me.  @CAPS4 the movie we went to a @CAPS1 restorant for dinner. While we were being seated my freind mumbled something i couldn't hear to his girlfreind, and she burst into laughter. I again asked what was so funny, and again they replied that it was nothing. During dinner, which was extrordiary for @CAPS1 food, my freinds girlfreind got up to go to the restroom. @CAPS4 she was out of earshot, my freind turned to me and said, ""@CAPS3'll never beleive what just happened. Me and her aren't fighting any more. @CAPS4 @CAPS3 left to go to the restroom, I asked her if she could remember what we were fighting over, and she said she had no idea and was just fighting because she diddn't want to loose the arguement. @CAPS4 she said that I fessed up and said i was argueing for the same reason. this made us laugh so hard because we boh realized that the argument could have been over long befor that night."" @CAPS4 this I almost never heard of them fighting again. This was untill they got into another arguement when she moved out of state. The arguement was over the fact that he wanted to do a long distance relationship, but she didn't want to. Since laughter saved their relationship for a little while I strongly believe that Laughter is an important part of a relationship. It also serves as an excelent ice breaker for a conversation."	15	17		32				3	3	3	3	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	3						
20911	8	"            @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2! Laughter, you need it to survive in this world. Someone should laugh at least ten times a day. Have you ever heard, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile? Well, I believe that it is true. It's more convenent to be happy than being sad. According to me.  In @DATE2, my family was living in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION1. My mom and dad had @NUM1 baby girls, before my brother and I were born. It was a beautiful snowy morning on @DATE1... Christmas! My sister, @PERSON1 in a bright yellow dress was @CAPS13 excited to be getting presents and cake! As soon as @CAPS6 opened a big battery powered monster truck, her beautiful clear blue eyes got as big as watermelons!  @PERSON1 walked over steddily, and climbed into the huge truck. There was only one problem, @CAPS6 couldn't reach the pedals. Everyone stood there, silent... then they started busting up laughing because @PERSON1 awkwardly looked like @CAPS6 was dancing in the truck beacuse @CAPS6 was trying to reach the pedals. Then my mom said, ""@CAPS3 someone should go help @PERSON1 get going on the truck."" @CAPS4 that was probably the worst idea ever!  My @CAPS2 is @NUM2 years old, and about @NUM3 pounds, and not in the best shape. @CAPS6 said annoyed, ""@CAPS5 I'll help @PERSON1."" @CAPS6 rolled up off the couch and stood by @PERSON1 and the truck. My dad was giggling in the background. My @CAPS2 said seriously,""I need a stick or something to push on the ""go"" pedal."" @CAPS6 went and found a long stick outside in the snow. They decided that they should try it outside because @PERSON1 wanted to feel the chilling wind on her baby soft face as @CAPS6 was riding in the truck. @CAPS13 my mom bundled up @PERSON1 in @NUM1 jackets, gloves, and a beanie. Somehow they got on top of a @NUM5 foot snowy, and slippery hill we live on. My @CAPS2 pushed down on the ""go"" pedal and it went forward @CAPS4 the front tires got caught on her long dress @CAPS6 was wearing and ran her over! The next thing we know, @CAPS6 is tumbling down the hill screaming on the top of her lungs! That's when her red flowered dress flew up and we could see her tong. My sister said loudly,""That's gross @CAPS2!"" @CAPS9 just some minor bruises and scratches my @CAPS2 was @CAPS5. That was the @CAPS10 @CAPS1 @CAPS9 my @CAPS2 ever! I watched it on the @CAPS11 video.  We @MONTH1 put that video on the ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12."" @CAPS13 if you see it, just remember me chuckling in the back of her head. @CAPS13 remember, you should always laugh or smile more than frown or be mad. Laughter, is the key to a happy life!"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20913	8	" Laughter  @CAPS1 brings enthusiasm and joyfulness to any means or matter. Have you ever thought of laughter being a part or key element in a relationship? A time when laughter has really helped or made a relationship is when I met one of my still today best friends. I had just started fifth grade at a new school; I transferred from private to public. There was only a couple of people I knew there because of family, and these people were my cousins. As you can imagine I sat by the people whom I known for most of my life, and being in this position was very awkward. So, eventually at the end of the day I was ready to leave school and it was my first time I ever got to walk home since this school was much closer than my last. I had to walk home with a kid who lived right by me; this I had never known because of my sheltered young life. Luckily he was easy to talk to and we both had something in common which was skateboarding. This is when we started @CAPS1 because we talked about certain falls we had which were not so pleasant and he asked if we could hang out after school, and with me as a shy guy I said okay. After awhile, he came over with his skateboard and he told me to go down this ramp I had. So, I did and fell right on my back which we both thought was hilarious and we started @CAPS1 together. This @CAPS1 we did since walking home really made me feel comfortable with him and kind of bonded us. I feel that fall was a key part of our friendship because it made the awkwardness go right out the window and helped us start talking about more funny thing which we had seen. Ever since, every time we hang out something happens and we laugh as hard as you can imagine which goes down in our memories as good times. @CAPS1 has always ""sweetened the mood"" so to say and always makes a good time a great time to remember or to a truly boring time to a ""lets go do something"" time. Also, in any situation when I have been @CAPS1, or start to laugh, I feel good because every one laughs when I laugh. Most of my friends are also my friends because of my laughs and times I make them laugh. All in all, most of the relationships I have are because of @CAPS1 and how they comfort two or even more people by bonding them, and making every one feel like their having a good time with each other. This is key because than most encounters with people, even friends can be very awkward or not enjoyable. So, really in any case @CAPS1 is necessity because than every thing would be dull, plus you would really have no one to be able to have an appreciative time with. Therefore, every time I meet someone new or even someone I know laughter needs to exist in order to have a relationship with anyone."	15	19	34	34				3	3	4	3	3	3	5	4	5	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	3	3
20914	8	" A lot of people always say that a sense of humor is very important when looking for a significant other, or even a friend. @CAPS4 some people don't realize @CAPS1 how much laughter can bring people together! I know now that all it takes is for two people to laugh together to become great friends. My best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 became my friends by doing @CAPS1 that. All my life I've gone to small schools with my aunt, @LOCATION1. We are only two years apart so we usually can stay within the same @ORGANIZATION1, so I never feel alone. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 ended up going to a different @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 than me. I would have to face @ORGANIZATION1 on my own. My freshman year of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I was pretty nervous. It was my first time at a huge @ORGANIZATION1, I had @CAPS1 moved and I didn't know anyone, so I was pretty shy. I made my first friend pretty easily during one of my classes; @CAPS3. @PERSON4, the teacher, wanted us to have partners, so that we could do a certain exercise together. @PERSON2 and I both chose each other for some reason, I don't know how, @CAPS4 we were drawn to each other. @PERSON4 told us we would be doing the ""mirror exercise"". We picked somebody to be the mover, and somebody to be the mirror. @PERSON2 ended up being the mover. I had to follow her movements exactly so that @PERSON4 wouldn't be able to tell who the mirror was, @CAPS4 when @PERSON2 started acting like a monkey, we both laughed and @PERSON4 even laughed too. During lunch, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friend, @PERSON1. @CAPS2 claimed to have known her for several years. @PERSON1 and I smiled at each other, @CAPS4 we didn't really talk at all. By the time my last class of the day came around, I was ready to go home, @CAPS5 because it was a @CAPS6 class, I never really liked @CAPS6. I came to find that I shared that class with <@NUM1!</@CAPS7> @CAPS8 we met already, and shared @PERSON2 as a friend, we sat by each other. We still didn't have much to say though. A few days went by and we still didn't really talk, we @CAPS1 awkwardly sat next to one another. Meanwhile, @PERSON2 and I became closer friends, acting out silly skits together in @CAPS3 class laughter was bringing us together, @CAPS4 I didn't really notice, because it wasn't any different then how I've made most of my friends.  One day, we had testing in our @CAPS6 class, we had to go to the computer lab. @PERSON1 and I chose computers next to each other, we started our tests silently, same as always. Then, suddenly @CAPS2 turned to me and asked me if I had ever heard the ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12"". When I, very startled, replied no, @CAPS2 sang it for me, right there in the middle of the computer lab. When @CAPS2 finished we both started laughing so hard that it hurt. Our teacher warned us to be quiet, and we got back to testing with smiles on our faces. After that moment, everything changed! Like magic, @PERSON1 and I started talking and joking all the time! @PERSON2 noticed the change, @CAPS2 was glad we were getting along so well, @CAPS4 wondered what caused the sudden difference. To this day, @PERSON1 and I share laughs whenever we have the time for it. Even though I am busy with babysitting, @ORGANIZATION1, and my job. While @CAPS2 goes to college, nothing can stop the connection we made that day, through the power of laughter! I have learned that laughter is a top basis for any relationship. @CAPS4 it is not the only one. You also need to have trust. If you can't trust some one, @CAPS4 they are humorous, that doesn't make them a good friend. You also need a sense of safety. If your friends are encouraging you to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable, they aren't very good friends. I know that @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 are the best friends I will ever have. Laughter brought us together and I know it will keep us together for generations to come!"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20915	8	" @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever."	18	20	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20916	8	" Laughter is like feeling your alive, that nothing else matters, the pain in your life releasing, and the feeling that everything is alright. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even laugh when they aren't funny maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a little. When someone tells you a joke and its hilarious do you just sit and stare at them, or do you fall on the ground laughing? Personally I fall on the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughing it lightens the mood a little, makes it less tense in the environment. I have enjoyed many times by laughing at the silly things we do or at the dumbest things we do and make them not as bad by laughing about it. My friend and I have been going on adventures since the third grade. We go on walks and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we road her quad out to the sandy race tracks, and we climbed over fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we went on came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell are friends and family. After all these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you have. Let me tell you about a good time I had laughing so hard I even started crying. When your little you think things are a @CAPS1 more challenging @CAPS3 they really are, or things are a @CAPS1 more taller @CAPS3 they really are but that didn't stop me. When @PERSON1 and I were about @NUM1 years old we loved playing outside, climbing the trees, burying old treasures to find when we grew up, and spying on the neighbors. Well on this particular day @PERSON1 and I chose to ""spy"" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this cause they had kids, animals, and tons of cars so they were outside A @CAPS1. @PERSON1's dad had about ten tires just laying right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them plus on are toes just to peek over, but this time we felt that would be to obvious we needed to be more sneaky, more like a spike, and more secretive. Eventually @PERSON1's dad left to work and he stays gone for quite some time so we had things to prepare for. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally after time to think about it we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was I volunteered to go first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ORGANIZATION1 could try. Don't climb on trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out like you would of expected. As I got on top of the trash can it starts to shake and I was afraid so I held on to the top of the fence but the problem with that is I pushed the trash can further away from me causing it to tip over and me to hold on to the fence leaving me with the worst scraped hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had I needed something to cool down my hands fast cause they were burning. So we had the idea to look in her dads shop van through the first aid kit but well we were in there I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and placed my hands in front of it for a good half hour. @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 and I started talking about what had happened I thought about everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. Without laughter @PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today.  Laughing is the main source for friendship I feel. All the adventures @PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing at it afterward. You can look back at things and be like, ""@CAPS2 that really sucked."" Or you can look at things and be like, ""That is hilarious."" @CAPS3 laugh tell you cry. I could see laughter being the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less awkward, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be you without having to pretend your someone else. If friendships were based without laughter I don't know if they would be as good, well at least I know some of them for sure wouldn't be the same."	20	17		37				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3						
20917	8	"  The comfort of a laugh. Many different kinds of comfort can come from a laugh. My story is the comfort of love. @CAPS6 i was a young and foolish teen. (@CAPS1 wait that's what i would still be today.) A few days ago my friend @CAPS2 had me laughing so hard, and all because @CAPS5 slipped up while meeting my mother. (@CAPS2 was nerves to meet my mother.) For some reason @CAPS6 i started to laugh @CAPS5 suddenly began to act as if every thing was fine, and that there was nothing to be nerves about.  @CAPS7 latter @CAPS6 we went for our walk i asked him about it. I simply said ""@CAPS4 did your mood change @CAPS6 i began to laugh?"" @CAPS5 smiled and replied ""@CAPS6 you laugh i feel calm and know that i am going to be alright."" @CAPS7 myself being a typical teen girl i blushed, @CAPS7 quickly changed topics, while trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly i could not help my self. The feeling of his eyes on my cheek was over powering my will to not look. Turning my head slowly, sure enough there @CAPS5 was starring straight back in to my eyes, his eyes were wonderful they reminded me of sunflowers with a blue sky behind them. As @CAPS5 stared back i got a feeling as if @CAPS5 were trying to unlock all that i am, and all that i know with his eyes. As if @CAPS5 could see straight to my soul. Quickly I turned away. With a soft and almost beautiful voice @CAPS5 let a little laugh out. This laugh was as sweet to my ears, as nectar is to a hummingbird.  The next few days where hard. All i could think about was that walk. People must have thought i was crazy, every time i would remember the walk, each time i would remember his laugh. @CAPS7 let a laugh of my own out. @CAPS7 i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life. For me i laugh @CAPS6 I'm with the people i love. For some its watching t.v. that they find amusing, or maybe there kids did some thing rather silly. So silly you had to tell your book club. The point is that laughter is every where.  Laughter is never a bad thing in fact it has been proven that laughter has a lot of health benefits. Some people don't get it. Laughter is not some thing to be ashamed of ether, if some one laughs at you just laugh with them. Its not laughter that starts wars. its not laughter that kills people. its people who chose not to fill there lives with the joy of laughter.  So here is the goal. laughter can also be very contagious. So try and @CAPS8 a laugh on. Do some thing that @CAPS6 people remember it they will start there own laughs.

To me laughter is what makes people so unique. Everybody has a different kind of laugh. For example, when you are a baby @CAPS2 laugh is high pitched. The older you get the lower @CAPS2 laugh becomes, ""like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1"". If it was not for his laugh would not be who he is. When I was a child I remember trying to laugh like just like @ORGANIZATION1 did. I would be walking around the house trying to get my laugh really @CAPS1. My family though it was the best thing ever. They would ask me to laugh like @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 so they can get a laugh also.  Now today my laugh is what I wanted it to be, ""@CAPS1"". It is hard for me to laugh quietly now. I have had some people tell me things like; ""@CAPS2 laugh is what I will remember you by"" or ""@CAPS2 laugh is really something else"". I love my laugh because it is part of who I am. With out laughter you, me, or anybody else wont be they are now. Laughter is one way to show emotion. So go ahead and try different kinds of laughs.

So me and my little brother took two jugs of chocolate syrup, and poor them all over my aunts brand new three thousand dollar couch.

One morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was sleep, me and my little brother were sitting on the couch watching television and my little brother says that he has to go to the bathroom and knowing us kids we do everything together so me and my brother go @CAPS3 stairs to the bathroom, and we see the biggest box of fifty-four rolls of soft, lushes toilet paper.Me and my little brother love toilet paper rolls for whatever reason, so we open the box and my brother drops one in the toilet, so I put one in the toilet, then he puts another one in the toilet, then i flush it. Little did we know that it would back fire at us and the toilet started to over flow, but i kept flushing. Then i get another roll and start unwrapping it all over the floor, the my brother gets one and @DATE1 we are knees deep in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt walks through the front door, we don't here her because we are having so much fun in toilet paper and water, then she comes @CAPS3 stairs, goes to the bathroom too see me and my brother and a bathroom thrashed, full of toilet paper and water. But the only thing that she says to us is. CLEAN @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! She slams the door then me and my brother look at eachother then start cleaning. Then finally after hours of cleaning the bathroom is back to the way it should be.   @CAPS1 is the conclusion of my storie about the three worst pranks that me and my little brother have pulled on our aunt.

20921	8	" Being with family and friends during a memorable trip always seems to spark a smile. There are always times to look back on; whether they are fond memories, or thoughts of nostalgia. I was about to graduate, and my parents had just broke the news to me that we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 after the year was finished. We had the date set; @DATE1, right after school was over. The first reaction out of my mouth was filled with entreatment, wishing for my best friend to join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thoughtfully considered all the advantages and disadvantages, and rapidly responded in the affirmative. I was thrilled to know that the memories I was about to create with my closest family members were now to include my best friend.  First thing was first, I had to get down to business. I needed to call my friend, @PERSON1, and ask her if she'd like to come along. Selfishly assuming that her immediate response would be an exuberant ""@CAPS1!,"" I was @CAPS4 first devastated when she postponed her response and didn'@CAPS6 seem too excited. I didn'@CAPS6 consider the fact that there @MONTH1 have been some sort of miscommunication. She talked it over with her mother, and gave me a call back. I had made the mistake of not telling her that we would have her financially covered for airfare, dining, and hotel rooms. We cleared everything up, and they decided she @CAPS3 join us. The two of us together couldn'@CAPS6 have been more ecstatic if we tried! @PERSON1 and I made a countdown board that started around two months from our departure date. There were many factors that we would take into hand while planning. As we measured out exactly how much time we had, we also planned which landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend lived in @LOCATION1 @CAPS4 the time, so she gave us a tour of the island. Having such a close acquaintance to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangout spots, and had access to the military beaches because she works in @ORGANIZATION1!  Many humorous occurrences happened often while we were on that vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened in the hotel while I was with @PERSON1 and my mother. My mom has always had a way to make every situation hilarious, so it was a blast when we went out on a girls night. First, and most significant of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall that was attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of varied small clothing stores, food shops, and jewelry outlets. One of our favorite stores that we visited was a @CAPS6-shirt shop with chocolate infused fabrics! We spent so much time looking @CAPS4 all of the designs, that I think we ended up carrying a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night.  As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the town center, we worked our way back up to the room, laughing and involved in pointless girl talk. The three of us girls shuffled with smiles, sore feet, and new bags onto the elegant, ornately designed golden elevator. My mother pushed the button to take us to our floor, while @PERSON1 carried on a story about plans we had the night before. Absorbed in conversation, we hauled our new things down the long hallway to our room. Realizing that we didn'@CAPS6 have a key card to open our room's door, the three of us decided that we should just knock on the door and my father would answer. ""@CAPS2 was supposed to be back from renting our surf boards by now, so why isn'@CAPS6 @CAPS2 answering?"" we thought, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2 still be out on the beach?"" @CAPS4 this point our conversation died down a bit as we tried to figure out what to do. I sent a message to my dad's cell phone, and @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up pounding on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @CAPS2 was playing a joke on us by not answering. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I began to notice a low buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mother and best friend, and @CAPS3 barely keep from laughing. It was then that it hit me, and I said to both of them, ""@CAPS5 guys! We didn'@CAPS6 leave a @CAPS6.V. on!"" We immediately halted our intrusion, moved as quickly as we @CAPS3 away from the door, and continued to howl with laughter. My mother had hit the wrong floor button on the elevator! We were so absorbed in having a good time that we didn'@CAPS6 even realize we were bothering someone, and embarassing ourselves! It wasn'@CAPS6 just one moment or one trip, it is now a lifetime of joy because I can look back on those memories and smile @CAPS4 them. It's these moments that I treasure the most."	23	20		43				4	4	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20922	8	" Emotions are an essential part of life. Some emotions bring tears and laughter, which alone are two powerful and essential things to life. There was a time not too long ago that I was able to turn a girl's tears to laughter and made her day a little better.It all starts with the craze of today's teenage world, ""@CAPS1"". Which to those who don't know, it is a website where teens spend quite a lot of time on, and people can comunicate through this website. I log in and see that this girl I like is also signed in, so I start talking to her. The normal teenage conversation of, ""@CAPS2, whats up?"" that sort of thing happens, and then she asks if I am able to hang out. Now, tell me if I'm wrong, but most guys would go hang out if its a girl they like. I went to meet up with her at the library and as always, she was beautiful, even though I doubt she was trying. As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, yet when I asked what was bothering her, she did not wish to tell me. I didn't want to make things worse, so I left it alone. All I could thing about was what could I do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if it would help or not. To my luck, it actually helped, and she started smiling. After a little while, I had her laughing and having a good time. Since that day, we have been dating, and are really happy, and everyday when I see her I say something random to make her smile."	20	17		37				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	3	4						
20923	8	"            The Element of @CAPS1 and Laughter Laughter is an important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood. Laughing is a good part in a persons life; it shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a laugh. Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their emotions; other people laugh to hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at peoples accidents while others don't. Emotions are a big deal in a persons life. Some emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. Being happy makes people want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much, they will actually start crying from it. People like other people @CAPS4 are in a happy or joyful mood, because then they can receive those good feelings as well; therefore, it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well.  Another thing that makes people laugh are jokes. Some jokes can be very funny, other jokes can be gross, and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them. But jokes can get complicated at times; to a little kid you can say, ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2!"" ""@CAPS4's there?"" ""@CAPS5."" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?"" ""@CAPS5 @CAPS4?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke,"" and the kid would be laughing. But to someone @CAPS4 is older, you have to think a little more to get them to laugh. People love laughter; they like laughing at peoples jokes and especially at hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. Like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get pranked is alergic to garlic. But most of the time, funny things help people cheer up when they are down. Furthermore, accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times, but at other times, some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people. Some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other. For example, a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board, but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all. It is like when someone says that they a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around. You might think that you have something funny to say, but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that wasn't funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life. It is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. Enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs, don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time, be happy. Laughter is a good thing; people love it so don't always be serious and at least share some laughs with your friends or loved ones."	13	19	34	34				3	2	3	2	2	3	3	4	3	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	4	3
20924	8	"Laughter Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable, bring two people together or just show your having a good time. In my experiences laughter comes at the best of times. On a typical @ORGANIZATION1 day at @ORGANIZATION1 I was sitting with my friends at lunch time just hanging out talking about whats going on in our lives, when I notice a girl sitting all alone. I don't recognize her, she must be a new student. I ask around to see if anyone knows anything about her; no one knows. Looking back at the girl she looks very lonely and in need of a friend. Curious to meet someone new I walk over to her and make conversation after a little while we relax and start to talk about our interests. I remember her saying something funny and I started to laugh, she begins to laugh at my laugh being as its almost hysterical sounding and everyone thinks it sounds ridiculous. At that moment as were sitting there laughing together I realize, its bringing us together making us closer despite the fact we had just met but ten minutes ago.  Laughter makes life more enjoyable and happy knowing that you can share that with someone you have just met or someone you have known your whole life is magical. Its a universal language that everyone should speak. Laughing is healthy and good for the heart."	15	14		29				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	2	3	3	3	3						
20925	8	" There was this time during @CAPS1 vacation, and their was a lot of snow o n the ground. My cousin @CAPS2, brother @CAPS3 and I were all getting together and going to go out to my grandparents. My brother @CAPS3 lives in @LOCATION2 and my cousin @CAPS2, and I live here in @LOCATION1. So it wasn't that hard trying to get us cousins all together. We were all getting together to go out to my grandparents and go snowmobiling together and stay the night out their for a couple of nights. When all got together, and were starting to go out there it was getting to late to go snowmobiling. We were all very kind of sad but it was okay. We just watched movies off direct @LOCATION3, and waited for the morning to come. Once morning came of course it was way to cold to go out right when we woke up. So we made a big breakfast and after breakfast we all got ready and than sat around until it was warmer to go outside. Finally it was the afternoon! We all got dressed into warm clothes to go out an go snowmobiling. We all went outside and my grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could pull us from behind with it. My grandpa was driving the snowmobile and us kids were in the back. My grandma only went one once with us and than she got off because my grandpa was going way to crazy n we were all getting hit by each other when he was driving. Then once us kids were the only ones on the hood by grandpa was starting to go really fast! I was the only one who was covered in snow, and i looked like a snowman. It was so funny! My grandpa went running inside to get my grandpas camera so she could take some pictures. It took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures. Then when she was done we went back to snowmobiling for the rest of the day. After we got all done for the day I than really looked like a snowman. It was a fun day, and very funny how I looked as a snowman, but afterwords I got really cold. We went inside and I went right in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma was making hot chocolate for all of us."	18	12	30	30				3	3	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	2	2	3	3	4	4	3	3
20926	8	" We were heading to our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 sat, crammed together in our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the top, along with six other kids, occupying all of the other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seating arrangements didn't seem to ruin our fun, within five minutes of our road trip, the van exploded with laughter, as @PERSON1, most likely a future comedian started off cracking jokes, just being himself as usual. Within those first five minutes of our drive, I could already tell that this was going to be a ski trip I would always remember.  The van rolled up to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be lodging here for the long weekend. The sky had turned black with the @TIME1, and me along with everyone else trudged along with weary eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to hop into our beds, needing to be well rested for our first ski race of the season. Shortly after, everyone was soon in bed, knowing that five a.m. would be coming quickly. The sun began rising over the mountains, signaling time to wake up. This was not the case for me. I had been up for nearly an hour, and sat in our van while we sped around each corner up to the mountain. It was race day, and me, along with all of my teammates were all excited for the day coming. The morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, getting our lift tickets, and inspection of the course. I now stood at the top of the hill peering down at the course ahead of me. I had to focus. While I have had a lot of fun, it was time to concentrate, to preform my absolute best. The pressure was on. I now stood in the start gate, my coach stood by my side, and my friends were watching as well, cheering me on. I was hoping not to disappoint. ""@CAPS2 ready,"" the official began in a tense voice, ""@CAPS3!"" I threw my self our of the start gate. I flew by each gate, staying in control and most important, going fast. The wind slid past my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolled with each turn. Everything was going well until I broke over the knoll. My body compressed bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied over the roller, throwing me off balance. I fought to get back up, to regain myself, but I couldn't do it. My skis spun out from under me, causing me to be spit out from the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, hopeless and done for. It was over. I sat in the snow frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @PERSON1, one of my teammates, came up to me and sat in the snow by my side. My first thought was he was going to say something of a cliche ""nice job,"" or a ""you'll do better next time"". To my surprise he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns up, trying to contain a laugh, unsuccessful, I burst into laughter. @PERSON1 sits there and smiles at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick ""thanks,"" with a smile before we both @CAPS3 to watch and cheer on our teammates. Although I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day, I skied two solid runs with top finishes, if I had stayed upset with myself, I would have never been able to achieve those results. I came to realize that some days, just a small laugh can be all you need to turn any day around. Laughter, I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean many different things for many different people, laughter could be a special bond between to people. Laughter can remove the seriousness or competitively in a situation, but also it unites us. Languages are different among people, but everyone understands a what a laugh can do, a laugh is universal."	24	23		47				4	5	4	4	5	5	5	4	5	5	4	5						
20927	8	"                                        The @CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter seems to be almost the basis of ones relationship with friends, with no laughter, there is no spark of interest of wanting to be someones friend. When I think of laughter, I think of the times when I go to @ORGANIZATION1. Even @CAPS2 I have had the most horrible day, I know that the girls I play with on that team, who are like a second family to me, can always cheer me up by the things they say or do. The underlying relationship between a @ORGANIZATION1 team becomes unknown to the outside; no one really knows how much we laugh together, or how much frustration builds up between us. Frustration @MONTH1 get the best of us sometimes but I can think of a lot more memories where I was laying on the turf field laughing because a dumb decision of a player, turns into on of the funniest things I've ever seen.  I remember the first time I had a @ORGANIZATION1 practice, back in @DATE1 of second grade, I was playing with many girls who had gone to a different school and I had never seen before. All of the girls decided that they wanted to see who was the best at juggling a @ORGANIZATION1 ball on there knees. It came my turn to try, and as i went to bump it with my knee, it hit in the wrong spot so it came back up and hit me in the nose, leaving it bloody. I had no idea how to react, so I started to laugh. At the time, a girl I had never seen before started to laugh with me, and came up and gave me a tissue. Believe it or not the girl who gave me a tissue that first day became my best friend, and has been ever since. The laughter that occurred that day filled the gap of distance between us. Since that day we have never had an awkward silence wondering what we should say or do.   Entering the fall of fourth grade, I had just joined the @ORGANIZATION1 team @ORGANIZATION1, still playing with the same girls, with the exception of a few people. I had no idea what to think of those people or what to say, so i decided on not saying anything. We had been playing monkey in the middle and I was guarding a short blond girl named @CAPS3, who had extremely good talents but was a little clumsy. She had started to run for the ball, and low and behold the clumsy girl tripped on nothing! Thoughts were racing through my mind; should I laugh? Will she hate me @CAPS2 I do? What @CAPS2 she's actually hurt? Though these thoughts @MONTH1 become reality, I went with my instinct and burst with laughter. She rolled over to see who had starting laughing at her accidental trip, and started laughing as well. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing we had gone to the same school but never associated with one another. From that day on we became inseparable at school, and became best friends.  The next story has nothing to do with @ORGANIZATION1, but everything to do with laughter. Though there is no certain story that I could tell you in particular that happened between this girl and I, all I can say is she is the one who gave me the first experience of laughing until you cry. I remember her moving to our school, and I was no longer the ""new girl"". At first, I thought she was the weirdest person that I had ever met, but as time progressed I had come to find out that she @MONTH1 be one of the funniest people I have ever met. @CAPS2 I would have made the realization beforehand that this girl had the personality she did, I would have went up to her in a heartbeat and made friends, instead of hiding behind the crowd. Ever since we became friends our friendship has been based upon how much we laugh together, and I wouldn't have it an other way. In the end the person who once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", was absolutely correct. I used these stories above to show no matter how shy, or awkward a person @MONTH1 be, sharing a laugh with a new person is the easiest way to find a best friend. When I was introduced to laughter by these three people, I started to become more social throughout my middle school years, and now onto my high school career as well. @CAPS2 I lived a life without laughter, I would lose the life I have, and it would be filled with dull memories that are not worth sharing, and to me, that is definitely not worth it. Over the past six years, I have gained three best friends due to laughter, this really does go to show that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and is truly a @CAPS1 to have it."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	3	3	3						
20928	8	" Laughter is a daily part of my life. I'm always laughing in school or at home. With laughter you can show many emotions that can't be told with words. To me, it's also a way of showing how fortunate your life is. I've had numerous occasions where laughter was the solution to my problem. I also agree that laughter is an important part of a relationship. In then next paragraphs, I am going to talk about how laughter affects my relationship and the benefits it brings to it as well. Approximately three months ago my family and I decided to take a trip to @LOCATION2. We planned to stay there for a month or so. When I told my boyfriend that I'd be gone for a month, right away I saw the sadness in his eyes. This truly killed me however, our decision was made and there was no turning back.  Our relation was tense during that month. We talked a few times but his voice was different. There was a sadness to it and I knew something was wrong. Although he said everything was good I knew his sadness was due to my absence.  After the month had finally ended it was time to come back to @LOCATION3! I was truly excited. We arrived at @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 at @TIME1 on a @DATE1 @TIME2. I immediately called him but there was no chance of seeing him that same @TIME2. Although, just knowing that I was closer to him made me happy and anxious. We conversed for endless hours, telling each other that we would never be that far again. We laughed and laughed during our whole conversation. To me the sound of his laughter was a sign of his happiness and that was just priceless. The laughter was as if it had been a blessing to our relation. From that day on forward, I realized how much laughter really affects me in numerous ways. It's as if it brings happiness and prosperity to my life. With just a laugh sadness leaves and that's when happiness jumps in."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfathers face. He had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that @DATE1, so many years ago, he shined his happiness @CAPS1 love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My @CAPS16, who we all called @CAPS5, had a way of keeping the peace @CAPS1 happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry @CAPS3 @CAPS5, @CAPS1 no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was. @CAPS5 was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on my @DATE1 @DATE1 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. That @DATE1 was our family's @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5, soon after, he passed away. When I look back @CAPS1 realize how important that @DATE1 was I can see that it was a perfect @CAPS8 for everyone. It was a happy @DATE1 @CAPS1 my @DATE1 memories of my @CAPS16 were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.     When that @CAPS8 kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Every one in my family was in high spirits @CAPS1 was ready to enjoy the @DATE1 @CAPS3 family. My favorite activity during each @CAPS1 every family event is to play my favorite games @CAPS3 everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called @CAPS12-@CAPS13. Now @CAPS12-@CAPS13 was one of the many games that my @CAPS16 was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, @CAPS1 would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced @CAPS5 @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON1 to play @CAPS12-@CAPS13 @CAPS3 me. We went into the spare room @CAPS1 starting dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, @CAPS1 to no ones surprise, @CAPS5 was winning. It was just before the food was ready @CAPS1 we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin @PERSON1, or @CAPS5 said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny @NUM1 year old ears had ever heard, @CAPS1 I began to laugh.     My family was so thoroughly entertained @CAPS3 my laughter that they could not keep their smiles @CAPS1 laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy to my family, including my @CAPS16. @CAPS5' smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful @CAPS1 vivid in front of me,that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. @CAPS5' smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.    No one knew that was our @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the @DATE1 I would spend @CAPS3 my @CAPS16. Everything was so perfect @CAPS1 so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, @CAPS1 if I had to choose my @DATE1 @CAPS8, that @DATE1 would be perfect. My single memory of that @DATE1 was laughing, @CAPS1 being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my @DATE1 bit a time @CAPS3 @CAPS5 then a @DATE1 where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, @CAPS1 smiles.    Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, @CAPS1 can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt @CAPS1 never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, ""@CAPS25. Laugh. Love."" I believe those three words can combine together, @CAPS1 act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to @CAPS25 out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, @CAPS1 love. Love brings us all together, @CAPS1 when we strive to be happy @CAPS1 to love, that is when we can truly @CAPS25. My grandfather loved each @CAPS1 every one of his family @CAPS1 friends @CAPS1 made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever @CAPS25 it. He died after a life full of love happiness @CAPS1, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter.        "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

It can improve relationships, make friendships grow stronger, and even start @CAPS5 make two people who don't know anything about each other, extremely close. You can meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh you feel like you want @CAPS5 get @CAPS5 know them better. I love that feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both have @CAPS5 be @NUM1 and female, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady, or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. Last @DATE1 I never had anything @CAPS5 do, so I decided I should start volunteering places. The two places I could volunteer at were: a daycare next @CAPS5 my house, or an old folks home about @NUM2 miles away. I thought really hard about it, trying @CAPS5 make the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided I should do both of them, so I could meet some new people, and have new experiences. I started with the daycare. I woke up at @NUM3 am, and walked @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION1. I wasn't sure what it was going @CAPS5 be like at all. I didn't even know if i was good with kids. I walked in, and stood @CAPS3 awkwardly. The @ORGANIZATION1 manager came up @CAPS5 me and asked me if i could help out with the @NUM4 year old's coloring room. I nodded my head nervously.  Was i supposed @CAPS5 color for them? @CAPS3's no way they could color a picture by themselves. They're only three! I thought. Oh well, if i follow directions then this day will get @CAPS2 faster. When i went in @CAPS3 all the kids ran up @CAPS5 me with a smile on their face. ""@CAPS1 by me!"" one said. ""@CAPS2 here!"" said another. ""@CAPS3's a spot right here!"" ""@CAPS4 at my picture!"" ""I drew a rainbow!"" ""I drew a car!"" ""I drew you!"" @CAPS5 that, i looked down. @CAPS3 i was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I was laughing and having a great time with the kids. I learned that i absolutely adore kids, and I'm actually pretty good with them. The next week a went @CAPS5 the nursing home. I was even more nervous @CAPS3. I felt so out of place. I hadn't found out what I was going @CAPS5 be helping with yet, so I sat on a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked who i was her @CAPS5 see, i said nobody. She then asked me why I was here, and I replied, oh, I was going @CAPS5 volunteer. She led me down the hall told me that it was almost time for lunch so i needed @CAPS5 get ready @CAPS5 serve lunch. I did, and then the i heard, what i assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was honestly great. If one of them looked a little down, or upset I could flash them a smile and they would grin back, obviously in higher spirits than before. After lunch, I played a few games of chess. Most people who were @CAPS3 took naps after lunch, so @CAPS3 were only three people out @CAPS3. I played first with a lady who used @CAPS5 be a nurse. I got @CAPS5 know her pretty well in the half hour we played the game; which i won. Next was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the @LOCATION1 war. He seemed really nice, but serious. I won that game too. The last man used @CAPS5 be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game! Maybe he said a few @CAPS5 many, because he beat me at chess. Well that was my excuse. When i got done, i was in a great mod and i could't wait @CAPS5 come back again. I learned a lot that @DATE1. I found out everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized you don't have @CAPS5 be the same as the person your with, @CAPS5 laugh and have a good time. It doesn't matter what age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying @CAPS5 make the best of your day. I am so glad i decided @CAPS5 volunteer, otherwise i would have never known so much about people, love, life, and laughter."	20	21		41				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	5	4	4	4						
20932	8	" Looking back on my early childhood, one thing that stands out bright and shiny in my memory is laughter. Since birth, I have always loved to smile and laugh. I've found a kind of comfort, peace, and confidence through laughter alone, which I doubt I would have been able to find somewhere else naturally. This could, in part, be because of my @CAPS1. We rarely get to see each other because he lives in @LOCATION2 and I live in @LOCATION3, but when we do have the luxury of spending time together, it is always full of laughter, and full of joy. I credit him for giving my my love for laughter. I've been told by my parents that as a baby all my @CAPS1 had to do was laugh, and my eyes brightened and a smile became apparent as wide as the @LOCATION1 on my face. It's been that way ever since. One of my earliest memories I have is laying on my parent's bed listening to my @CAPS1 tell me jokes. Every time he finished I would erupt in laughter, and, at the sight of me laughing, he would burst out too. The important detail to note is, when my @CAPS1 laughs, his belly shakes violently like @ORGANIZATION1. I found this the greatest part of the jokes. Once his belly started bouncing up and down, my laughter became uncontrollable. Our laughter escalated until tears were streaming down our faces. Besides having a belly that bounces when he laughs, my @CAPS1 has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs one has ever been lucky enough to hear. It's one of those fabulous and enriching laughs which words do not do justice, but once you hear it, you won't ever forget it. His laughter can light up the darkest room in a house. For me, his laugh almost has medicinal healing. Whenever I hear my @CAPS1 laugh, for just a moment, the world stops, and everything within is okay. I am not the only one who has a great appreciation for my @CAPS1's laugh. My father and him both have a love for telling jokes, which I have observed over the years, is one of the few items they hold a common agreement on. Everything from politics, to religion, to who should pay for dinner, usually ends in an argument between them. Because of that, they tend to stay clear of those topics for fear of confrontation. They have never mentioned this, but from my observation over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the laughter they share so often, acts as the glue which keeps their relationship strong. Were it not for laughter, I sometimes wonder if they would still have a working, loving relationship. I will forever be thankful for the great gift my @CAPS1 unknowingly gave me at such a young age. He created a deep and passionate love for laughter inside me, which has gotten me through the roughest times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they are bonded for a moment in a precious, fragile, and sacred way. My day can be going horribly, and in the instant that a joke is cracked, and laughter overwhelms my body, everything brightens and the worries and stresses of my day seem so minute. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson that my @CAPS1 taught me. If you can find humor, you can find serenity in the most disastrous moments. Laughter, to me, is somewhat like a drug. It's a harmless, enriching, and life-saving drug which I can proudly say I hope to be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @CAPS1."	20	20		40				4	4	5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20933	8	"Laughter is such a marvelous element to have in any relationship. For instance if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship than I'm pretty sure there is no strong connection between the two of you. For example I was in a relationship once where we didn't have that element of humor, and I truthfully did not enjoy that relationship that her and I had. Any type of relationship needs laughter rather its friendships, boyfriend or girlfriends, and even family. All different types of relationships need some form of humor to survive. Sometimes families don't have that humor for each other but they'll still have that special type of a friendship, the reason for that I believe is because your family will always be there for you unlike most friends would. One way I know this because one of my friends really liked a guy, I could have sworn she @MONTH1 have even loved him, when he told her that he started dating some girl, she had cried for weeks, than when she was at her moms house one of her brothers she believed hated her said he wants to hurt the guy that had made his younger sister cry. They @MONTH1 not of had a humorous friendship, or even a friendship at all, but I believe laughter isn't necessarily always needed especially within family. All types of relationships are like plants, the flower is the relationship and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong. But without that water the plant wont grow, just like laughter in a relationship. I know that if I knew someone who I did not find to be humorous I know our friendship would not be very strong, unlike someone who I felt was hilarious. Laughter is always a important element in everyday life. For instance if you are going for a job interview you really need to connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression for yourself. One way of doing that is through laughter, I have heard of many stories about job interviews, a example of one is my mom had a interview not to long ago for a @CAPS1 job and she told me about her interview and she said they had really connected. Their was also some seriousness and some laughter in that interview than three days later they emailed her and told her that she got the job and that they would love to hire her. and I have heard of interviews where they didn't get the job. My sister had a interview once for a pet kennel type of place where they drop their pets off there while they go on vacation, and she said that her and the person interviewing her had no connection which had led to no humor or laughter. So I believe humor is such a marvelous element to have within a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness."	17	15		32				3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20935	8	" Laughter is key. You never really think about laughter in importance, but the truth is, laughing brings the most opposite people together. Last year, I met one of my brothers friends in school. We never really talked but she seemed nice. We had a class together and we started talking more and more everyday and she was best friends with my best friend.  @PERSON1 was her name and she drove a bright orange @ORGANIZATION1. We hung out after school one day and I leaned the passenger seat all the way back and was sitting on it like a dog and she slammed on the brakes and I flew into the front of the vehicle and I couldn't stop laughing. At that moment I knew we were going to be friends. I was a freshman so I didn't really know anyone and she was always nice to everyone so we started hanging out more. I lived about @NUM1 miles out of town and her brothers went to school about @NUM2 miles past my house so we had to go pick them up. We bought a game called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' and there are tons of little jellbeans that were flavored like vomit, centipede, dirt, rotten egg, etc.. So we were playing while we were driving out there and @CAPS3 had to stop the car nearly @NUM3 times in our @NUM4 mile drive! Those were the nastiest beans ever! Then, we would drive out to my house and we'd listen to our favorite country songs and blast them in her car. She was my ultimate best friend and no one could replace her. Whenever we would get in fights we wouldn't start drama, we'd always have an actual fight because by the time one of us were pinned the other was laughing too hard to do anything about it. Her dad and my dad became friends later on too and we would always have barbeque's and family get togethers.  We also talked in a @CAPS4 accent all the time because one of our friends was from @LOCATION1. Whenever we went to @CAPS5 to go shopping we'd use our accent and everywhere we went people would ask us where we were from. Before we knew it our dads started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang words and then the whole school started using them. She is a great friend and she keeps me laughing everyday. Whenever @PERSON1 was having problems with her family she knew she could always talk to me and I would always be there for her. She always called me sister instead of @CAPS6 because we were so close. She used to take @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 classes at my old high school and when she got the fake baby doll it would keep us up late into the @TIME1, that baby was crazy. @PERSON1 would be driving and the baby would start screaming in its car seat and we'd have to pull over and find out what was wrong with it. She'd be a good mom. She always cared for things, even the smallest little thing she would cherish.  One time, we painted her little brothers room because we were bored and @PERSON1 was rolling her paintbrush in paint and texting and she took her eye off of her phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it for like @NUM5 minutes and by the time she did find it it was totally covered in green paint! I laughed at her for so long and those are the moments I wish I could bring back.  Everytime we hung out I would laugh and I realize now how important that laughter is to me. About six months ago I moved to a whole different state and I don't see her very often. There is no one like @PERSON1. She could make me laugh and was always just @NUM5 minutes away when I needed something, now I have to drive about @NUM2 hours to even see her. I haven't laughed like she made me ever since I went back to visit. Laughter is key, as I stated before and if you frown, you'll never know who is falling in love with your smile."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
20936	8	" A few years ago, when I was @NUM1, I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the color of the clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of @CAPS11, I did really @CAPS1 in school, and I also had a very 'up' attitude. @CAPS6 clothes were all very bright and 'happy' colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed, and the darker colored clothes they wore, would make their mood and attitude would dip. The experiment would last one week, and in that time I would try @CAPS7 to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I got to black, to see how I would be affected, if affected at all. To get started, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try @CAPS7 to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that i only had to wait for the @DATE2 to end and @DATE3 to begin. @DATE3 @TIME1 I woke up and did @CAPS6 usual daily routine, then tried on @CAPS6 new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised looks from @CAPS6 classmates @CAPS2 they took in @CAPS6 outfit. @CAPS11 was pretty tough @CAPS7 to laugh at some of their expressions but I couldn't, because that would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day, I got comments on @CAPS6 clothing, and some of @CAPS6 teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing @CAPS2 usual but when I told them of @CAPS6 experiment, they understood and said, ""@CAPS1 luck."" @CAPS2 the day came to an end, I was satisfied with @CAPS6 success and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if @CAPS6 theory would be proven wrong. But on @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS6 mom pointed out that I seemed different.  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 okay?"" she asked. ""@CAPS4 don't seem @CAPS2 energetic @TIME1, and your @CAPS7 smiling at all. Your @CAPS7 sick @CAPS3 @CAPS4?"" I told her that I was fine. At school, I was asked the same thing, and after a while @CAPS11 got really annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry and they forgave me, telling me @CAPS11 was probably just the experiment. I got a little happier at the thought that @CAPS6 theory might just be correct. That day went by slowly, and I was glad when @CAPS11 ended. @DATE4 was the last day of @CAPS6 experiment and for that I was happy. I didn't mind the dark clothes and I liked the way they looked on me, but @CAPS11 was hard @CAPS7 laughing, and @CAPS11 was starting to make me feel depressed. That day I decided to wear some of @CAPS6 bright clothes to see if @CAPS11 would change anything, and when I got to school some of @CAPS6 friends didn't recognize me because they got used to seeing me in @CAPS6 other clothes. I didn't feel any different from when I wore @CAPS6 dark clothes. In @CAPS5 I had to stand in front of the class to give @CAPS6 conclusion. ""@CAPS6 theory has been proven semi-correct,"" I stated. ""@CAPS7 laughing did have an effect on @CAPS6 mood and attitude. I was yelling at @CAPS6 friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But I found that wearing dark clothing didn't change anything."" @CAPS6 teacher then said something so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone applauded and said, ""@CAPS9 back @CAPS10!"" @CAPS11 feels really @CAPS1 to laugh again."	18	20	44	44				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4

Every time we are together, or we start talking we will laugh an crack each other up. Laughing has helped us get to having a great relationship were we can tell each other anything. I can go to her any time an ask her for help. I can go an talk to her any time I need to now. Be for we had a great relationship she wasn't doing to good she was involved in not to good of things. She was very depressed too. Ill tell you a little about it.   My day started off as a normal school day, I got up got ready, got on thus to school then be for I new it I was on the bus on my way home. I get off a block or two away from my house and then I walk home. I walk and walk, an about ten minutes later I get up to my house. I go to my room an put my bags down on my bed and go say hi to my mom. I walk into her room an shes sitting their in a chair. I had asked her if she wanted to go on a walk. Well of course she said yes.She gets her shoes on an I do the same.We walk down are drive way an that's where the walk starts.        We started walking down the road after we got to the end of are drive way. We walked straight for about five minutes, then take a right.We walk that way for about ten minutes an turn left. Their is a little store on that coroner. We stopped their to buy some water an some snacks on the walk. After we get done we start walking east on the road. When I looked back at my mom she look like she was having a really bad day. Like anyone i asked her what was wrong. She talked to me about everything and she seemed really sad, and depressed. From that I knew i need to talk to her an make her laugh. We never had the best relationship because she was always gone hanging out with friends. I knew if i could make her laugh, an help her get better, it would help us get along better an help each other out in the long run. I love my mom an I hate seeing people down. I though all this in my head. Being around me makes everyone laugh.  The walk was about three to four miles long. for the rest of the time I got her to laugh an laugh the whole way back. It made her feel a lot better i know that. Later that day she came in my room and we played some bored games and watch a movie or two. We really just talked and hung out for the rest of the day. We went on a couple more walks for the next month or two and we got a good mother an son relationship. We were both happy this had happened. About two months from the first walk w had she came up to me and hugged me and told me thank you for helping her out with what she was going though. I think laughter is a great thing in life. For me it helped me out a lot in life an it helped me save a relationship with my mom. I love laughing, and I love making people laugh it is fun to laugh an fun to make people laugh. Laughter makes great friendships. It can have a lot to do with your life. I hope this helps you laugh more and makes you try to be funny an have people laugh with you.

20939	8	" Laughter is just one of those things that doesn't go away very easy. The simplest things can make you laugh or smile the point is happiness is going to be around for a while. My dad laughs, my mom laughs I laugh everybody laughs its a good thing to have. If there was nothing on what to be happy on then people would be in fights and country's in wars. Anger is not something someone wants to deal with all the time; you have to relax every now and then.  My parents and I know that happiness is what drives us to good things. That's why we embrace it in our house we like to acknowledge it to my younger siblings. My dad and me have a good relationship as well with my mom we get along well and laugh together.  Me and my girlfriend @LOCATION1; we started out in a good relationship but as time went on it was starting to fade. We weren't communicating as well and that's what was driving us apart. We were just ending up in fights all the time and for no reason fighting just seemed to find us all the time. We talked we hung out and we started getting along better laughing at our joke or our constant teasing to one another. We had a good time she said that she liked us laughing and having a good time. I told her that laughing and enjoying ourselves is what brought us together. Laughing is the key to our happiness its what made me and her closer its a main key point to any relationship.  If there is no happiness then there is no laughter, and if there is no laughter then how are you suppose to get happiness. They work together and its a good thing to have in life where would we be if we didn't have it. We would all have a grudge and for no reason to have one and just live in black and white all the time."	15	16		31				3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
20940	8	" A few years back me and my dad were siting at home watching @CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they came inside they repeatedly didn't shut the sliding glass door, finally my sister shut the door but her friend @PERSON1 didn't know, he was running so fast and before he knew it he was going fast first into a sliding glass door!  My dad and I were laughing so hard i almost peed myself. After we finally stopped laughing and went to go check on him and he looked really confused about what just happened. We looked at the door and without a doubt it had a slobber mark going up the door as if his face was slid across it. Meanwhile after more laughs and fun things calmed down and we went back to watching @CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was laying next to him, my dad kind of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started watching @CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw that the cat was sleeping and took an advantage over it and slammed his hands on the chair. It scared the cat and it jumped about two feet into the air, Once again we started laughing really hard but this time my stomach started hurting. @DATE1 on about @DATE1 my dad my bother and I were working in our garage and found an electrical @ORGANIZATION1 starter. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and so i did. He flipped the switch and next thing i know i was being electrocuted. We all started laughing once again. Next it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tensed up and left him @CAPS4-able to free himself from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears cause it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocking ourselves we came up with the idea to put it on our tongues, i tried it first and my tongue started pulsing like a beating heart. My dad couldn't keep himself together long enough to keep holding the button. As a result to all these great funny times we had our @ORGANIZATION1 starter broke, we gave our cat away , and @PERSON1 moved. In better words funny times @MONTH1 be in the past but there always in your memory to bring a smile to our faces.. "	20	14	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	2	3	3	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	4
20942	8	"A @ORGANIZATION1 is a wondrous gift. It allows your mind and your body to conjoin with others. It is the root of happiness, and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one at your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and by myself. I was empty. Solitude was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I had thought that I @MONTH1 be the only person in the whole world, something had come to save me.  I was six years old when they got divorced. I couldn't stand to hear my parents fight. One day we were the perfect family. We would play board games and go to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me and then he was gone. Was I ever going to see him again? Why isn't @CAPS1 living with us? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think i was too young to truly know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself becoming sluggish and glum.  About two weeks after my @CAPS1 had left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to me and my mom. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of the new people in town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever, and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding my bike and thought that I should stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell over. I heard a laugh and turned around. It was the new neighbor kid. There he was rolling on the ground, grabbing at his sides. He must have thought of my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, began to move, then crashed once more. Another series of laughs sprang from this boy. That was the first time I had smiled in a long time. I grew fond of whatever feeling or humor I was giving off to this new kid. I asked the boy his name and he didn't respond; though he did start to laugh again. It was my voice that he was laughing at. Everything I did caused him to become hysterical. I found out later that he was from @LOCATION1 and didn't speak a word of @CAPS2. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart begin to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start to my new beginning. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I am always reminded of him when I hear a laugh. Though he's not near me in a physical sense, I am guided by his laughter every day."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
20943	8	"Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS4 went upstairs @CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step-brother was on @CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step-sister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @CAPS46 with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was going her word-search @CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS34 we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom said, ""@CAPS1 me?"" @CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked over the list @CAPS2 suddenly said ""@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!"" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy. Which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 I start laughing really hard @CAPS2 ask, ""@CAPS7's @CAPS8?"" I was saying it wrong @CAPS34 when @CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  ""@CAPS7?"" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed it to her. ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13."" @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say."" I comment @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 were several things on @CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like, ""I don't know."" @CAPS2 then I asked her another. ""@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know."" @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS34 ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""@CAPS26 thanks for that picture."" @CAPS27 mom said. ""@CAPS7? Ear-hair?"" I asked @CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto ""@CAPS29"". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""@CAPS30"" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said ""@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  ""@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head."" I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked in the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' @CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. ""@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats."" @CAPS4 managed to get out @CAPS2 I'm looking at her. ""@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?"" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. ""I don't know."" @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then said good-bye @CAPS2 left. ""@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills."" I snorted at @CAPS7 @CAPS4 said. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills."" @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""@CAPS46 away."" @CAPS4 said with a smile. ""@CAPS48."" I said before turning @CAPS2 walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS24 kind of had to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS49."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4						
20944	8	"                  The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This @CAPS2 started out like any other @CAPS2. Me waking up thinking what am I going to do. So I walk out of my room, ask my mom if we have any plans. She says that we don't have any plans. So after I talked to her some more. I went back into my room and there I saw that I had gotten a text message from my @CAPS1 friend @PERSON3. He asked if I wanted hang out with him. I decided of course I can because I had no family plans. ""I would love to hang out with you @PERSON3"".  @PERSON3 and I met at the @NUM1 bus stop on royal and we went to @ORGANIZATION2. See now the reason why we went to @ORGANIZATION2 was because the @CAPS2 before I had gotten a gift card from my grandmother and fifty dollars from @CAPS4 (@CAPS4 is my biological father). When we finally got to @ORGANIZATION2 asked me what are we going to get here. I said anything I want. him start busting up laughing. I bot a jackass shirt and some food. From @ORGANIZATION2 we went to @CAPS6 @CAPS7 to get some delicious food.  When we walked into the restaurant, the aroma from the place made us drool a little bit. @PERSON3 got a big bowl and stuffed @CAPS15 with everything he could. We ate so much. I ganged like ten pounds. We talked about life and how awesome the food was. Where we were going next was still undecided. We finally finished our food. I payed for the to bowls of food and we went to our bus stop and went to downtown @PERSON1. While we were on the bus @PERSON3 decided that we shall go to @ORGANIZATION1.  So we got off the bus and what do you know my friends @CAPS8 boy, @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @PERSON2, and @PERSON4 were downtown chill en like a villain. @PERSON3 went and smoked a cigarette. While I went and checked the bus schedule for the @ORGANIZATION4 bus. Him and I had to wait for @NUM2 minutes. So we gust hung out with our friends. @CAPS9 is the funniest guy @CAPS3. I laughed until I started to cry. I almost pissed myself.  We left to go get on the bus, laughed some more. When we got to the @ORGANIZATION4 we had know idea why we even went there. So we just walked around. @PERSON3 decided that we should into the photo booth to make this @CAPS2 legit. I had a lot of fun getting our picture taken. Next place we went was @CAPS11-topic. I love that store. We were in there for @CAPS3.  About two or so hours pass.  At the @ORGANIZATION4 there is this park that you can go to but you have to cross the bridge to get to @CAPS15. @PERSON3 and I got bored and went on an epic adventure to this park. There was a couple trails that we walked. I tripped on a branch. @PERSON3 laughed at me. We found this piece of concrete. @PERSON3 and I put on some music and danced to @CAPS12 @CAPS13. I love @CAPS14 music its really fun to dance to. I had orange soda that @PERSON3 drank. I took a lot of pictures of him drinking the soda. We pretended that the grass was lava and the concrete was a place for break dancing in cave man days. I took a video of @PERSON3 dancing and laughing to the song @CAPS15's the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 by sponge bob. He also ate all of my chips that i bot at @ORGANIZATION2. After that we went back onto the trails and skipped through the tree's. I trow skittles at birds and old people. While telling them to taste the rainbow.  We finally realized that we needed to get back home so him and I started walking back to the bus stop. Missed the first bus the caught the next one. Hung out downtown for an hour. Chilled with my downtown friends at @NUM3 park. Got a donut from @ORGANIZATION3. That place is epicly bad ass! Got some intents from this cool store by the station.  As the @CAPS2 ended @PERSON3 and I went our separate ways home. Both still to this @CAPS2 saying that, ""that @CAPS2 was epic""."	16	15		31				3	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3

20946	8	" Human beings are...unusual...Okay, we're weird. There are so many people in the world, including ourselves, and the only way we can like ourselves is if we can get others to like us; if that isn't strange enough, we still don't like ourselves no matter who likes us. Just what are we thinking? We are always using relationships to assist our understanding of who we are; it's a gamble to even have those relationships. Face the facts, we risk so much on relying on others; we give them the ability to build us...or break us. Our major goals as youngsters is to find people to like us. I think it might even span to later times in life than that! From my experiences I know there are two key points in knowing a person can build us: trust and kindness. Finding builders with these traits is as easy as understanding if they bring you joy or not.  A person can give you joy by simply being kind to you...but if you want a whole swarm of friends, then this isn't exactly the best way. It's not that kindness is a bad way to make friends...it's just that it's not the fastest method. If a builder is kind then of course you would become their friend...in time; in order to immediately know a friend when you see one, they will make you laugh. Laughter makes us enjoy our time with our friends, it's a golden rule in the book of @CAPS1, if there is such a book. And it was through laughter that I made my experience in @CAPS2 class better. @CAPS2 class, to me, was extremely stressful. Every day we had either a speaking assignment or we had paperwork; and the class was really slow. Why was it slow? It was slow because we could hardly get through one set of instructions without some group speaking or finding some other way to disturb the class. A good example would be this one class project we had to do. As usual, instructions were slow; I was at my boiling point. Today seemed different though, despite the the usual annoyance, not a single student asked for a repeat on instructions, in fact, they all seemed to understand and immediately started working. I too followed in with this action. The assignment was, each group of about three to four people had to create a script using the vocabulary learned from the supplied booklet; it took a whole class period and then everyone went home to do their other work. The next day we returned to @CAPS2 was definitely an interesting one. The teacher had all kinds of strange props lined up for us. apparently we were going to have the audience act out our script, our job was to read it out loud. My group was first to entertain and we had finally selected our volunteers and actors. Tiffany, @PERSON1, and I sat down in the back of the classroom ready to read the script, not sure what the actors would deliver. Our play was... a success?! By the end of the first sentence everyone was giggling. As we moved further on to the next play the laughter had grew louder. Students were really enjoying themselves and more people volunteered to preform until it was difficult to choose actors. Even I, the classroom-snob, was enjoying myself. The plays were fun and random, some play would send everyone into hysterics. I can easily remember one of the groups making me laugh so hard that my sides were aching, tears lined my lids, and it was almost impossible to breathe. This project was definitely the best one I had ever participated in. It's moments like these when we build strong unity in the classroom, we enjoyed all of the people around us and we enjoyed ourselves. I was so use to being angery at my classmates that I was taken by suprise on that one day. Enjoying their plays so much, I now look at them as an entertaining group of students, rather that the annoyance I had seen them as before. No longer are these people strangers in the hallway, now they are family. It really is amazing how something as simple as laughter can change ones outlook on others and themselves."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5						
20947	8	"                                  The @CAPS1 of Laughter  @CAPS2 would we be without laughter? Would we still have relationships/friendships like we do @CAPS5? Laughter brings out a sense of @CAPS1 closer to someone, a sense of humor, a friendship, and a positive environment. Personally, I feel as if the world would be a miserable place to be without laughter. I can assure @CAPS17 life would not be the same as it is @CAPS5. Without laughter, @CAPS17 @DATE1 vacation would not have been anything like it was. Over @DATE1 vacation @CAPS17 friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @PERSON1 (@PERSON5). This however, was not as easy as it @MONTH1 sound, seeing as how nothing could ever bring her down. We tried out hardest to embarrass her, but nothing was working. We tried throwing her into a pool while her crush was around, dumping our drinks all over her just as a group of cute boys walked by, calling her names that only a grandmother would call a child. @CAPS14 name it, we did it. @CAPS12 was like a brick of marble, extremely hard to break. One day, @CAPS17 closet friend @PERSON2 came up with the idea of grabbing a pair of shorts, removing the seem on the butt, and gluing it back together in hopes of it ripping when @PERSON5 bent over.  ""@CAPS3 @PERSON5,"" I began, ""@PERSON2 and I found these shorts @TIME1, and thought that @CAPS14 might like them. They're super cute, and would go perfect with your new yellow tank top."" ""@CAPS4! Thanks guys, they fit great!"" @PERSON5 screamed as @CAPS12 filled with excitement. ""@CAPS5 let's go to the mall!"" @CAPS6 about an hour or so of walking around the mall, I threw @CAPS17 phone down and acted as if I hadn't noticed. However, @PERSON5 freaked out and ran @CAPS6 it as it slid down the walk way. Just as @CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab i,t her crush, @PERSON4 walked right behind her. Next thing @CAPS14 know, her shorts were split right down the middle, and her cheeks were bright red. @PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @CAPS7 face was priceless. I wish I had had @CAPS17 camera.  We had never seen @PERSON5 so mad. @CAPS12 was absolutely fuming, yet @PERSON2 and I were still @CAPS9 @CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @CAPS10 someones pants splitting in front of a huge crowd of people @CAPS10 the mall?  ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11,"" @CAPS12 screamed. ""@PERSON4 saw @CAPS13, and @CAPS14're @CAPS9? He's never going to talk to @CAPS11 again. I hate @CAPS14 guys!""  ""@CAPS14 don't hate us. That was hysterical and @CAPS14 know it,"" chimed @PERSON2. ""@CAPS15 like we embarrassed @CAPS14 pretty good, huh?"" ""@CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! @CAPS16 @CAPS17 @CAPS18! We broke the rock. We actually broke the rock,"" I giggled as @PERSON2 and I gave each other a high-five. A few minutes later @PERSON5 began to crack up @CAPS9, and apologized for freaking out @CAPS6 realizing that it was all in good fun. Little did we know, @CAPS12 was planning to get us back. By the end of @DATE1 break we had been to nearly every party, but there was still one to @NUM1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We all had a gut @CAPS1 that this was going to be the best one yet.  Everyone was having a blast @CAPS10 @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were going, there was crazy, loud music, the hot tub was @CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there was a bunch of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just as the party was about to come to a halt, @PERSON5 decided to undo @CAPS17 bikini top, and pull @CAPS19 bikini bottoms down! Humiliated, both of us ran in @LOCATION2's room, and locked the door. How could @CAPS12 take it this far? Was our practical joke this embarrassing to her? Tired of all the nagging coming from @LOCATION1 and @PERSON3 about us running away, we decided to leave the room and forget what happened. Let's just say that we know what we did to @PERSON5 was wrong, we wont do it again, and we @CAPS5 know not to mess with her to the extent that we had during our mall trip. Honestly, I feel as if this whole experience brought us closer to together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Consequently, @CAPS14 can @CAPS5 see why I feel that laughter is an important part of a friendship and/or relationship. It makes the world go round. Do @CAPS14 have any experiences @CAPS2 laughter brought @CAPS14 and a friend, significant other, or family member closer together?    "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20948	8	" During the @CAPS1 break my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""@CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" @PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON4. @CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME1 when my @CAPS5 was still home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @PERSON2 and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in @LOCATION4. Just being in @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to be. Espicially when I'm with my friends and family."	19	20	40	40				3	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4
20949	8	"                                  ""Laughter"" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes others and yourself feel good. Laughter is one of the best feeling we can have, although it can hurt if its too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves, and forget about the bad in life. Anyone can laugh, and anyone can make others laugh. Without laughter, life would be such a bore. But you never want to push laughter, because even laughter has a limit.  There is different ways to bring laughter in someones life, and there is different ways of being funny. There is good ways of being funny and bad ways. A bad way is being the class clown, it becomes annoying, rude, and it can get you on your teachers bad side. A good way would to tell a joke or maybe sometimes embarrassing yourself can work. It seem to be the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think it was. I know that I can be funny at times, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it is never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making another feel bad can make you look bad, and others @MONTH1 not think of you as funny. You never want to put another down, people have feelings, and hurting someone only makes you look like the bad guy.   @CAPS1 people think that happiness is in fairy tales, also love, but when you really want happiness than turn to your friends and make them laugh. Getting another to laugh feels great, and it helps build up confidence and character. Having confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love, and others @MONTH1 think about you in a better way. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just appears for no reason at all.    Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being a bore can make you seem like your not an interesting person or not really all that fun. When people fall in love they find someone to share their life with. Sharing laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part in life. There is many adventures that life will take you through.  I love to laugh, it makes me feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good on the inside and out. I also love to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going right, I knew that she wasn't happy and I didn't want her to feel like that. So as a friend I helped her out and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Ever since then we've been best friends and she has never felt like that again. Laughter really is a great thing to have, it brings happiness to us all. And getting others to laugh makes you more of an interesting person, being an interesting person makes life easier and more stress free.  Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, along with sadness. When I'm down, I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes just the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think that laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something that is just as great, is like finding a meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we'll never know, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is a part of life, and a privilege. So go out and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good."	16	20		36				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20953	8	" A while back, I had a friend named @PERSON4. We were best friends; like two peas in a pod. We would hang out everyday, all day @DATE1.  One random day we walked up to our other friend @PERSON1's house to see if she could hang out. We all were hanging out all day when @PERSON1 came up with an idea. She wanted both me and @PERSON2 to stay the @TIME1.We stayed out a little past dark and just walked around @CAPS1. We stopped at @LOCATION1's house so she could get her clothes then left to go back to @ORGANIZATION1. On our way there, we stopped, again, at @LOCATION2's house and chilled for a while. We were there for @CAPS9 @NUM1 minutes just laughing @CAPS9 all the crazy stuff that has happened over @DATE1 already! When we were finally giving hugs to go to @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @LOCATION2's older brother, smacked @PERSON1 on her butt and told her it was nice. We made fun of her for the longest time for that! Not to mention how @CAPS3 kept talking @CAPS9 that until he moved to @ORGANIZATION2.  When we left, @LOCATION3, @PERSON4 and I were singing to @ORGANIZATION2's new @CAPS5 when some random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I directed him to where he was going and he said, ""@CAPS6 you,"" and drove away. When he had gone, @PERSON4 looked at me and screamed, ""That was the hottest guy I have @CAPS7 seen!"" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 the time we reached the @CAPS10 down the road we saw the guy again. @CAPS8 this time he wasn't so hot. He had a scruffy face and long, brown, straggly hair tied in a ponytail and was dressed like a hobo. I, still to this day, give her crap @CAPS9 it. That was the greatest @TIME1 of @DATE1.  We ended up going to the @CAPS11 @CAPS12 to buy some drinks when @PERSON1 started freaking out @CAPS9 losing her @CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps all the way back to @LOCATION2's house, hoping we'd find it. Re-retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find it. By then it was probably @CAPS9 @NUM1 @CAPS14'clock @LOCATION4. We finally gave up and decided to head back to @ORGANIZATION1. Before We even stepped foot in her front door, her mom comes darting out and starts screaming at @LOCATION3. So her mom took me and @PERSON4 back to my house @CAPS8 by the time I knocked on the door, because it was locked, and everyone was asleep so we had no where to go. So for that @TIME1 @PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @TIME1. Almost fell asleep in the laundromat when i remembered that my aunt @PERSON3 was looking at a small, white truck for sale in the @CAPS15 parking lot. The truck had a bed in the back, no, i don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor of the laundromat so we crawled in.  It was a tight squeeze, @CAPS8 we managed. Plus it wreaked of dirty socks and pee. It was, for sure, the worst thing 've @CAPS7 smelled. @CAPS8 no doubt was it the funnest @TIME1 I've had with that girl."	16	15		31				3	3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3	3

20955	8	" Everyone laughs differently , some people laugh so hard that they cry, and some don't. But one thing that they have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy, or happiness, or even if something is just really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something for instance maybe you are having a bad day and then one of your friends comes up to you and tells you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, right? Having a good sense of humor is something that can help you get through tough situations, embarrassing things, or even like I said just a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and even something that you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing, it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it. Whenever I laugh I always feel better, laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of good times I have spent with friends and family, it reminds me of all the inside jokes my friends and I have come up with over the years and that we can still laugh at just as hard as we used to. I believe that laughing is enjoyable for everyone it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you younger. When you laugh at things it creates long lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about them again in the future you will still think it is just as funny as before. Some of my best friends laugh at everything, they think that every little joke is the funniest ever, their laughs are unforgettable you can always hear them laughing. Which in another way shows how laughter can make anyone happy. If you believe that you are not a funny person, just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and most likely start laughing as well.  I enjoy getting to spend quality time with some of my closest friends, and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ORGANIZATION1 for the beginning of @DATE1 before going into high school. It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from middle school. We packed up my family's car and headed out for @ORGANIZATION1. Not even half-an-hour into the car ride and we are already cracking up laughing at every little thing going on. We always create great memories and this one was already in the books for one of the best. I am sure that the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun, we sang songs and danced (as much as we could buckled down in a seat) to as many songs as we could fit in those two hours. Of course during the car ride we got stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the others cars watched and laughed at us even the construction workers though it was funny. We made a boring moment fun. Once we finally got there we did not hesitate to drop off our bags and grab our bikes and take off and explore. The weather was so nice, not a cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about how excited we were to be out of middle school and moving on to high school. The next day we decided that we wanted to float down the river on a raft, sounds like a fun idea. Well it would be if we actually knew where we were going, I used to do it all the time with my family so I had an idea of where to go, but still five girls two rafts and a river, maybe not such a good idea. During the whole river raft trip we jumped back and forth between the two rafts occasionally splashing each other with the oars. Knowing us we laughed the whole way down the river. Whenever we passed people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us by how much we were laughing and enjoying each others company. By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry good thing my mom had prepared us some lunch for when we got home, when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and my mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh. You know you have built a good friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the inside jokes you have with each other. All because of one little thing called laughter.                                     "	18	22		40				4	4	4	4	4	3	5	5	5	4	4	4						
20956	8	"Laughter can be used for many things. One of which can be the important part of a relationship. There are many key parts in a relationship. But, the most important one is definitely the part of ""laughter being the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 laughter can cure the emotion of being sad. @CAPS1 it doesn't cure it.   If laughter is the shortest distance between two people then if a guy or girl meets someone they like. For instance, I have went up to a girl before and couldn't figure out anything to do or say. So, I just tried my best to make her laugh. It @MONTH1 have taken a few days of trying really hard to do so. But, in the the end, i was more comfortable asking her out and feeling more comfortable around her and her friends. @CAPS3 I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because it is never a good thing to see her in a bad mood. Now on some occasions I have made people laugh and it not mean anything. But, @CAPS3 I make my girl laugh then it was totally worth it. Because I can cheer her up from being any kind of sad or angry to making her happy and full of laughter. It @CAPS1 helps with being depressed too. Her being depressed is kinda like a train wrecking off its tracks. It never turns out good. But @CAPS3 she is happy, she can be full of joy, all giddy, and @CAPS1 very spontaneous.  I know @CAPS1 being alone and laughing is good. But you can @CAPS1 get called crazy if you are laughing at nothing at all. The best way to know someone is possibly feeling better is laughter. If they laugh then they can't be mad, sad, or any kind of emotion besides happy, or maybe sarcasm. But sarcasm can be blown off like it is nothing. If I ever try sarcasm to make people laugh I always end up offending them. So I always just be myself around everyone I come around.  So if you ever hear that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. You should know that it is true. Because not only do you get to a lot more place and get to know someone more. But, you can also learn valuable things about life through being closer to more people. @CAPS3 you hear that phrase, ask yourself, ""@CAPS2 I capable of making someone laugh? @CAPS2 I able to pull off laughter and actually be close to someone?"" @CAPS3 you do that, you'll know that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	4						
20957	8	" Each person filed in, one after the other, making a human train. The metallic red bell chimed once as each person pushed the door slightly more open. Walking in, I was enveloped by the smell of @CAPS1 food and conversations that hummed in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. To the right was a wall covered in @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 symbols and meanings, while to the left were hundreds of tables already filled. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom. I so badly wanted to plop myself down at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there silently. With moms knowing what's best, she shoved me towards the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did as she told me, like always, but made my reluctance clear. Walking over to the table with the speed of a slug and my feet dragging on the floor, I awkwardly stood in front of the circular table. Yanking out one of the chairs, I turned to my mom with a pleading look as desperation filled every fiber of my body, for I knew there was no way she would give in. Staring at these six relatives, I didn't know how I could manage to sit here the rest of the evening.  We had all gathered at a @CAPS1 restaurant for my grandpa's @NUM1 birthday. Each of his children had flown from the mainland to @LOCATION1 in order to spend this special moment with him. I hadn't seen these cousins for over @NUM2 years, and some much longer. I had already visited with them since we'd been in @LOCATION1, but I hadn't talked to them much, none the less when we were all together and forced to mingle.  With my napkin on my lap, I sat and looked at my cousins, each one staring back at me like I was an animal at the zoo. After a moment or two, they seemed to forget I was there because they averted their gaze and began talking amongst themselves. The only person at the table who I didn't feel like a complete stranger towards was my cousin, @PERSON2. She had wavy brown hair with blindingly blond highlights, sun-kissed from those bright tropical days, along with that brown @CAPS6 skin that made me jealous. We began talking, and soon I found myself enjoying the moment.  It wasn't until the food came that we actually began interacting as a group. Being teenagers with bland palates, everyone stared as the waiter brought the first dish. After asking the friendly waitress what it was we were about to eat, from her broken @CAPS7 we deciphered that they were buns with duck inside. Frantically trying to get all of the tables served in fairly constant intervals, she left our table and all of us looked at our food blankly. No one wanted to take the first bite. One of my cousins, @PERSON1, stepped up to take the masculine role as the dare devil. We all waited tentatively as he chomped down on the moist bun and swallowed. Once done chewing, he smiled and it seemed this dish had won his approval. Digging into my buns, I began to wonder if maybe these people were easy to relate to and I had made a small thing into a big ordea. From then on, I would just be myself and stop worrying about not having seen anybody for years; All I needed was to be myself.  The way the courses were set up left plenty of time to chat between each plate they brought. Since I was no longer worrying about what to say or how to say it, I easily fit into the conversations and began to relax. Shortly after the duck tray was removed from the table, it was discovered that my cousin @PERSON1, who is from @LOCATION2, pronounces certain words with an accent. Soon everybody began comparing the way we pronounce things to the way that he does. After each difference we found, we would chuckle. Things carried on like that for the rest of the @TIME1, everyone laughing at things that were only moderately funny, but we found hilarious.  It was that @TIME1 when I realized, even though you @MONTH1 be uncomfortable around a group of people who you don't know very well, finding a common ground helps you to ease that discomfort. Finding something that you all enjoy talking about @MONTH1 be hard to do, but finding something that makes you laugh is a lot easier. Laughter is something that everyone enjoys and can take part in even if they're not contributing to the conversation. By feeling as though you're a part of what's going on, you feel accepted, and that's all anyone ever wants."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20958	8	" People say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A @ORGANIZATION1 I saw @CAPS6 to be true was when I met a girl named @PERSON1. Three years ago I was at a city @CAPS10 swinging, wondering if it would hurt if I jumped. I took @CAPS15 chances and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air , noticing the unbalanced feeling of falling in @CAPS15 chest, everything slowing down, the temptation of what will happen when I hit the ground was vast. Sticking the landing was a fail and getting up from it wasn't much of a success either, until I felt hands upon @CAPS15 shoulder and arm. I looked up at @CAPS15 helper and saw a girl. Not @CAPS5 a girl but a gorgeous girl. A girl with green dazzling eyes that can stop an angry rhino charging toward her, hair the flowed with the wind, soft, gentle skin that would make you think that @CAPS11 could be hurt for how soft it was.""@CAPS1."" Was all I could squeeze out.""@CAPS1, are you okay?"" @CAPS3 asked with a very concerned tone.""@CAPS4 I'm fine, @CAPS5 forgot to stick the landing. Thanks for helping me, um whats your name?"" I returned with a @NUM1, and your welcome. whats your name?"" @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 giggled before @CAPS3 said her name.""@CAPS7, do you want to walk around with me?"" I struggled to vocalize.""@CAPS8, but I have to @CAPS9 at the @CAPS10 because @CAPS15 mom will be here soon."" @PERSON1 stated. during the walk around the @CAPS10 we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking each other random question's that the other person had to answer. I figured out that @CAPS3 was @NUM2 years old, her favorite color was baby blue and @CAPS3 always wanted to be a doctor. we walked around the playground some more @CAPS5 talking about past memories or something that happened to each other in the past. I asked her if @CAPS3 had a brother and sister. her response was that @CAPS3 does have a brother, and two sisters. While I was listening to her I noticed @CAPS3 was very deep into thought and asked what @CAPS3 was thinking about and @CAPS3 quickly replied. ""@CAPS11, @CAPS5 wondering why I'm so happy with you.""""well it could be that I'm making you feel good by laughter. Or it could be @CAPS15 charms working on you."" I replied with a @CAPS12 accent.""@CAPS13 @CAPS4 its definitely that."" @CAPS3 barely got out the words cause of laughter. Suddenly there was a car horn honking and we said our goodbye's and @CAPS3 left. I sat there watching the car go down the road and was hoping that we @MONTH1 see each other again, but in a way I knew we wouldnt because @CAPS15 mom, and I were moving from the city to a small town half way across the country. Turning around and walking back toward @CAPS15 house for the last night in the city all I could think about was her and how a little bit of laughter became the @CAPS16 to friendship."	17	18		35				4	4	4	4	3	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20959	8	" When a day is qualified as perfect there are a lot of things that go into making it so. Most perfect days in people's teenage years are in the @DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in the @DATE3, nor was it on a crazy @DATE4 break in @LOCATION2. My perfect day was on a @DATE2 in the middle of @MONTH1 in @DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best one of all. A friendship that is based on fun times, memories, story telling, and laughter. By @DATE1 I had spent multiple weekends with @ORGANIZATION1. However none were as hot as that weekend in late @DATE4. We decided we needed to cool off and with that said, we set off for @CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the truck bed. Arriving in @CAPS1 was peculiar because I was so far out of my comfort zone. It was also peculiar because I hadn't met a single soul @ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first lay my eyes on @PERSON1, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 I couldn't fathom how @ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, driven, proper, and intelligent. The boys that shook my hand were into things like big trucks, fishing poles, and a loud country band. I didn't think upon first meeting them that opposites could attract or become fond of one another. As the day progressed I found my comfort zone again. As the hours flew by and jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized just how similar we all really were. I didn't think that all of the childish things we did that @DATE2 in @MONTH1 would matter to me months down the roads, but they do. When we were running by the dirty creek with black lipstick painted on as war paint and laughing so hard we cried, I realized just how perfect the situation was. If that day wouldn't have brought laughs to my lips and my mind to it's comfort zone, it would have been a day long forgotten. If you go back on every happy memory you have, there is always one common ground. A joke, or even a funny face makes you laugh extremely hard. Every time I drive through @CAPS1 I think about the day when the sun was hot and we sat by fishing poles exchanging laughs. I think about @ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping over our own feet. I think about @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 laughing and pointing as we attempted to go swimming.  After all of the crazy running and swimming we were quite wound up. @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @PERSON2 asked us to take a walk; so we accepted and off we went into the brush. Within five minutes of our departure, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us on the top of a hill of little round pebbles. I'm not sure what events lead up to @LOCATION1 pushing @PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @PERSON1 pulling @PERSON2 down with him. I also recall @PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of sliding rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. Nobody was texting or messing with a machine. Around us was laughing and serenity which danced like music around us. The day had no stress and it had the perfect amount of sunshine. It was like something you only dream about. Once you are in a moment like that, where your own little world is pulling you closer, you never want to leave it. When your on the laughing high, you disconnect yourself and for a few brief seconds your life is in it's simplest form. You are simply you, no racing thoughts, no rushing emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughs could create or better a friendship. On that @DATE2 I realized that the laughs shared between @ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory for what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think about when I'm doubtful of the world. It'll always be a memory that makes me appreciate living. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 that @DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing made me closer with people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles bounded my world into @ORGANIZATION1 and into the world of a few @CAPS1 rednecks. And as of a @DATE1 @TIME1, that has made all the difference."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20962	8	" Moving around from place to place was always hard, I hated the thought of never seeing any friends or family. Never was the only word I could hold on to, there was no point in hope it was a futile feeling. I knew I would dearly miss @LOCATION1, and @ORGANIZATION1 just sounded so far; a twelve hour drive seemed like the edge of the earth to me. I visited @ORGANIZATION1 before, it was boring to tell the truth, and on top of that looking for a new house would bore me furthermore, all I could think about was @LOCATION1. Now I was moving there! When I first heard about the move I was infuriated and tried to fight against this poor decision, I was sure that my parents were making a mistake. As hard as I fought I could not win, my tears coulden't move my parents in the slightest way even In my greatest efforts, I was broken and confined to the moving van for twelve hours but to me it felt like forever. Finally my departure was over and my legs were sore and tired, I didn't want to manouver out of my seat or even touch @ORGANIZATION1's soil. The ground was dirty and tainted and the apartment complex was old and overly occupied, the rain and mud didn't help my attitude much either. Everything about this place was digusting and the thought of still sharing a room with my younger brother made me feel sick to my stomach. I stepped foot out side and entered my apartment and went straight to my bleakly colored room. I sat down and collected my thoughts trying to determine the pros and cons of my situation. The walls were caving in on me and they seemed to take the shape of bars, I was condemed to this fait that I could not escape untill I turned @NUM1, and that was more than @NUM2 years away! I was stuck in my apartment for three days before I wandered outside, but it wasn't all that horrible concidering it was raining all the time even at the end of the @DATE2 which was abnormal for me. I didn't want to leave my room or my apartment, all I wanted to do is watch @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons in my room. I felt alone and out of place I had no friends to talk to, my parents wouldent listen to me, and my little brother was only @NUM3 so he wouldent understand. There were no more smiles when I found out that I had to go to school the next day. Aloha park sounded like some school that would have great funding and spoiled rich kids in it but it was actually the exact opposite. It was an older school with kids that mostly lived in lower income housing at the time. In someways it was rather comforting knowing that I lived the same way temporarily. The first day of school was frightening, it was my first major transition into a new unfamilliar place. My teacher was old and grouchy, she seemed to have a major chip on her shoulder. Suddenly, out of the blue she held my hand in the hallway which was humilliating and definately not comforting. I heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me I thought I would never make any friends. The humiliation was withstandable but the thought of being in this class for the next nine months was a fear beyond belief. My teacher told me to take a seat on the far side of the room next to three boys, they all had the same expression which was an amalgamation of both alienated confusion and territorial pride. The feeling of being unwelcome would be an understament of the new nervous sensation that had surrounded me. I sat down unaware of the actions that the three boys might deal on to me, surprisingly the only occurence was a series of temporary stares and an aquard silence.  As the day continued life had again had become somewhat casual, until the boys had started to talk about the opposite gender and my attention was directly turned towards them. I sat there and quietly listened and smirked at the inapropriate conversation that I was clearly not supposed to be a part of. They laughed and snickerd and covered their mouths embarassingly, as I looked at them and concidered them amatures of the comical arts. I wanted to say something that I held onto for the whole conversation and then I took my chances to add a most important joke and quickly I muttered my overly inapropriate sentence. They confusingly looked at me and asked me what I had said, I wasnt sure how they would take the joke but I risked another chance and repeated it. The group of boys grew silent and the only noises were those of the other students talking to eachother, suddenly they bursted out laughing. I was overjoyed that they had a sense of humor, and after that I had friends and @CAPS1.    "	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20963	8	"                 Laughter at its @CAPS1  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS1 they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH1 actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON1 and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20964	8	" It was @DATE1 seventh and I had invited my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, to go to my boyfriend's football game with me. It would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a different high school than we did. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house and then my @CAPS3 would take us to his game later. When we arrived at the end of the lane we started walking up to my house. Then all of the sudden ""ahhhhhh, @CAPS1 my god!"" @PERSON2 and I were both screaming at the top of our lungs, ""@CAPS2 a... ahhhh!"". @PERSON2 and I had almost stepped on a dead snake that was laying in the lane. While this was going on @PERSON1 had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked back at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing. She soon figured out that we had been startled by the snake and also started in ""you guys are so funny @CAPS2 just a dead snake"". We talked and laughed our way up to my house. @CAPS4 we had caught up a little and I had changed into my boyfriends #@NUM1 jersey, we went downstairs to eat. We sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started eating. My @CAPS3 came over and put her bowl down then went back into the kitchen to get something. When she came back she had napkins and another bowl, I playfully ask her ""are you really hungry @CAPS3?"" she said ""no..uh why?"" That's when the girls and I started laughing hysterically again, ""@CAPS3 you have two bowls you are obviously very hungry"" I giggled. She turned a little red and then said back ""well I do love chili, I can't ever seem to get enough of it"" then she laughed a little ""your probably right I should just start with one bowl.""  @CAPS4 we gathered the blankets for the stands we left. On our way up we made a pit stop at the famous @ORGANIZATION1. I was so exited to see my boyfriend and to have my friends come along that coffee was probably not the best idea, but we stopped anyway. While we were in there waiting for our coffee we passed the time by making faces through the nearby window at people who happened to drive by. We were cracking up over the looks people gave us, some looked like @CAPS5 thought it was funny while others looked like @CAPS5 thought we had escaped from a nut house. Soon enough our drinks were ready and we headed out the door. Then as we were walking to the car some guy whistled at us. We hopped in the car and then lost it when we saw that it was some guy who was dressed up in one of those statue of liberty costumes.  We were almost at the school and I was bouncy from the caffeine and excitement mix. My @CAPS3 had never driven to @PERSON3's school before, while my dad had only was busy that night. I was trying to keep calm while giving her directions in a very giggly manner. I started off by saying ""you go straight up here @CAPS3"" the my @CAPS3 and the girls said ""honey you can't go straight up here"". ""yes you can"" I argued then @CAPS4 a while @PERSON1 said ""girl look you could go straight but you ain't gonna see @PERSON3 if you do"". I realized @CAPS5 were right and told my @CAPS3 ""don't turn, just turn right"" she got confused cause I had said the directions wrong so she turned left. I started to freak, screaming ""no no no! we have to turn around I meant right"" @CAPS5 all burst out laughing at me ""man calm down woman, we just have to turn around"" said @PERSON2. We finally got back on track and I tried to give clear directions. I wasn't completely positive where the turn off was for his school so I told my @CAPS3 to go slow, when we passed it and I freaked out again. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS3 we have to turn around"" @CAPS5 all laughed at this and then my @CAPS3 said that she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and hopped out to pay and get in. We got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room. I got another dose of excitement, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 started to walk away so I could wave at @PERSON3. I pulled on their shirts and begged them to stay because I didn't want to be the only person waiting. Then I saw him run past and before I knew it I leaped off the ground and waved frantically. I saw him smiling as he ran onto the field, my friends laughed at how I jumped and we enjoyed the game."	16	20		36				3	3	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	4

To begin with, during breakfast @DATE2 @TIME1, we were all having a great time eating first thing in the @TIME1, but suddenly when my sister remembers about what had happened the day before at her job, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so we can also laugh with her about it. She had said that there was a banana lying on the floor, when her manager went by she didn't see it and slipped right through the hall. It was impossible not to laugh about it becuase it was the manager. Well that @TIME1 was going by so fast just by thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Every time I would remember I would start laughing so much that I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she had ever told us that happened ever since she starting working. On the other hand, when it was time for lunch, I was at school and my mom called me that same day. I answered fast but not knowing the reason why she was calling. Suddenly she said ""@CAPS3 you will not believe what just happend, your dog just got finished taking a shower and is running around like crazy on top of the beds and coutches trying to get dried off"" I couldn't believe it and I starting laughing so hard that I had to tell my freinds that were next to me and them too starting laughing as well. I could picture in my head how funny that would be if I was there watching her run around like a crazy dog. As the day went by, all I would do is remember how funny that is for a dog to do that, that I would just start laughing all of a sudden during class at school, but even though it was something good to laugh at I had to stop laughing because everyone was just staring. Finally, when it was time for dinner, at the table that night we all told eachother about our day. Everyone had something new to say but, when my brother started to tell us about his day at school, he couldn't even talk because it was so funny what he wanted to say that he was just laughing. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he came out he noticed that all his freinds were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he came out of the bathroom he had a big piece of tiolet paper stuck to his pants. I immediatley thought he would have gotten embarrased but instead he said he thought it was funny as well. My parents, my sister and I started to laugh so hard that we had even forgotten about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying their cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughter each day, it just wouldnt be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to have your day go by and wait for the next. We all at the end said that our day went by so fast, that it was or couldn't be true that the day was over and it was time for bed. The day of @DATE1 third was one of many days that was the best and that we all enojoyed and had fun laughing with eachother telling about funny things that happen to us during our day."	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4

20968	8	"                          Laughing is the key of happiness. Is a moment that is remember by many people. You share many laughs with friends, family and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and it could build a strong relationship. For me laughing means a lot, i laugh everyday. I will not forget the time when i was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem. One night me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could still fix them that there was a solution. He was calling me a liar, and more anger kept on building up. He was so hard headed and I couldn't get through his thoughts. He was saying that i could not fixed what i have done: whats done is done. I was getting really mad, I wanted him to go away and i thought i was not ever going to talk to him. We had a lack of trust and i just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would have got more mad and we were gonna end up screaming at each other. It got me so mad that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me, and he was disappointed. I got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was all ways telling jokes and teasing everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he would get me in trouble, it would end up with a joke at the end. The jokes he made when i was sad or mad would build our relationship stronger; we would always end up laughing. Later the night we were with all my family cutting my niece's cake and me and my dad were not talking. As we were singing happy birthday i would glare at him and look down. He was looking at me as if he was all tough. Then we were all saying ""-í@CAPS1 le sople!"", which means blow out the candles in @CAPS2. All of the sudden my uncle blows out the candle on accident and me and my dad stared at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying of laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It felt great laughing at the same thing and sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger. My dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was. It was only me and him who stayed laughing, everyone else giggled. As it was making my dad and my relationship better it build a connection between my family and I. Its a memory that's gonna last a life time, yet it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Although he was still upset about my grades it was all better. There was a connection between us and we could still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was about the night that i found the incident so funny. As it was making my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter it was all build up on the memory. Something me and him both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was as if it was not important, as if laughing made you change and helped us put it aside. Every laughing moment we have now is something me and him share, its now a connection. We both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger. Telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning. When you know you're happy is when you have a sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment when you made laughing an important part of your pass. When all those funny moments become important because that's when you showed you were happy. Its even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment. I know at times i will have moments where i am not laughing, but the key is to always look at the bright side. Even though me and my dad were mad at each other its a memory that will carry on with me forever."	18	18		36				4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3						
20971	8	" @CAPS8 families @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 was one of exploration, but also one in which we came to regret our move from @LOCATION3 a little. We missed our friends, our connections, but also places. The place @CAPS8 brother and I came to miss second only to our farm was a @CAPS3 we had dubbed ""The @CAPS1, @CAPS1 @CAPS3."" The place itself was a dump. Close to a dairy farm, it reeked of cow pats mixed with cigarettes. I remember that the grass was perpetually dry, and the bridge crossing the @CAPS3 was continually squeaking; it was an old, covered bridge, and on its last leg. So, it wasn't so much the place we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. On one particularly mopey day, our father roused us from our rooms, saying that we were going to explore a new @CAPS3. We knew about @CAPS4's adventures; we called them ""@CAPS4-ventures"" because they were truly one of a kind. Most of the time, we ended up miles away from any civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of ""@CAPS4-ventures."" @CAPS7, our mother was able to rouse @CAPS8 brother and I, and we were soon hustled into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. While @CAPS8 brother and I were in the back of the car, pining for our nice, comfortable rooms, @CAPS8 father had the audacity to laugh along to the radio, and open the windows of the car to our protests. Riding with @CAPS8 brother and I in the back were two circular lumps of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes, and could be used to drift down the @CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we arrived at a place called ""@LOCATION2 bend."" @CAPS8 brother and I jumped out of the car, and were met with pristine beauty. Covered in shade, the @CAPS3 flowed noisily, and we could hear it although we were not that close to the @CAPS3 bank. The grass was green and velvety beneath our feet, and the smell of fresh water welling up from the earth was delicious. The light filtered down through the trees and had a crystalline effect on the water. @CAPS8 brother and I hurriedly dressed into our swimsuits, while @CAPS8 father began to cart our food and supplies down the the @CAPS3 bank where we would be spending the day. As soon as we finished dressing, @CAPS8 brother and I chased after him, for the day was warm and the water looked good and cool. When our hunger had been sated, it was time to pull out the inner tubes. The water was nice and fast, with some white water and a very little water fall at the end. Being a rather petite child for @CAPS8 age, even these small obstacles looked like the most insidious of rapids, and they made @CAPS8 eyes widen a little. @CAPS7, I managed to steady myself, and prepared to get wet. At @DATE1, I hung on to @CAPS8 inner tube with clutched fingers and wild eyes, but gradually, I relaxed. I let @CAPS8 hand drift out to causally trail behind me in the water, drawing circles as the sunlight filtered down through the trees. As the water grew faster, I began to feel apprehensive again. I drew sharp, quick breaths as the little waterfall approached me. In reality, it was only about four feet tall, but in @CAPS8 panicked haze, those four feet looked like twelve feet. The white water was suddenly upon me, accompanied by a large and frightful shriek I gave. Somehow, I managed to stay afloat, and @CAPS8 ride left me smiling. I broke into long peals of laughter, laughing away all @CAPS8 homesickness and heartsickness. @CAPS8 brother came down the waterfall, spluttering and giggling, and we laughed together. Our laughter healed us, and for the @DATE1 time since the move, we felt totally and completely at home."	21	25		46				4	4	5	5	5	4	5	5	5	5	5	5						
20972	8	"        Falling in love, @CAPS3 @CAPS1 The falling part was easy, I remember the minute I fell in love with you. Everything about you shined, everything about you sparkled. You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun that human beings were capable of. Every time we were together there was no thought in my mind that we were not happy together, no worry that you would ever leave. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a child i had always had the title of the kid who smiles all the time, @CAPS4 when i thought of you i got this glow. Everybody saw it. they would ask, ""@CAPS2 have you been doing? Your so happy, I've never seen you like this before."" That, @CAPS2 they saw in me was the power of love. @CAPS4 something they did not see was @CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 one of us would do something @CAPS3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt from @CAPS1 so hard. that is @CAPS2 I love, I grew to love every part of you. Especially your laugh.  From @CAPS2 i hear, they say the laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I would have to agree. Being able to laugh with someone, @CAPS3 being able to be yourself @CAPS3 not have to hold up this front, its magical. Its something that makes a relationship last. I guess its kinda like glue in sense. My brother @CAPS3 i are the closest you can get to best friends, @CAPS3 guess @CAPS2 we do in our spare time? We laugh. Hes someone that i can be silly @CAPS3 dumb @CAPS3 goofy with @CAPS3 he still laughs, @CAPS3 he still loves me. :) @CAPS4, although he is my brother it still holds the same respect, @CAPS1 is great. It is also a stress reliever. My teacher told me so. My health teacher that is.  "	16	16		32				3	3	4	3	4	3	3	3	4	4	4	3						
20973	8	"    Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether the person is a relative, friend, or someone you are dating. Laughter makes you forget your worries and problems. But with a friendship based on laughter, when do you trade in the giggles for seriousness? I believe laughter is vital in a friendship. But to have a strong, healthy, relationship you also need a level of seriousness. This is the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships.    Olivia has been my best friend as long as I could remember, hanging out we laughed constantly. Laughter has always been a huge part of our friendship and always will be. But going into middle school we faced drama, boys and arguments, which we never experienced with one another. All of these small but important things to us then added up and began to make us drift apart. Our lack of sharing our feelings and instead cover it up with laughs caused us to bottle up anger towards each other. I always thought we were perfect matches for best friends because our countless inside jokes and the constant fun we would have. But our anger grew until we were ready to handle it, which we did not understand then.   We started to hang out less and less, and our daily calls became weekly. Both of us noticed a change in our friendship, but didn't know how to fix it, we apologized for fighting with each other and sympathized for our boy troubles but it wasn't the same. I missed her but the longer it went on the easier it was to not talk or hang out. Summer came around and our moms planned me to stay a week at her house while my parents were on vacation. To put it nicely I was less than thrilled, how was I suppose to stay a week there when we barely talk anymore? I knew everything would be okay but I still worried that the week would be constant fighting instead of laughs.    Finally the day came and my parents were driving me to her house. As I got there things were fine, we pretended nothing was going on and had fun, it was that way for a few days. But on the third day she broke the ice, asking what was wrong and why we don't talk anymore. That day something amazing happened, we talked about all our feelings and what was upsetting us. It was a little awkward at first but we got through it together. The fights got less and less because we knew the things that bugged each other, and everything slowly became better than it was before. That talk changed our relationship forever and I'm so glad she had spoken up when I didn't or else we wouldn't be as close as we are today.    That day was @DATE1, but had a huge impact on our friendship.Ever since we got that mile stone in our friendship I knew better how to be more open with other people also. Olivia has taught me so much but this was among the more important lesson. Laughter is a huge part of any strong relationship but you also need to be able to share your feelings and be serious. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with and I am grateful to have mine stick with me no matter what."	21	20		41				5	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20974	8	" Laughter is an important element in a relationship. It shows the chemistry in a couple, and it shows happiness within family and friends. How depressing would it be if the world had no laughter? It would be like the ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"". The joyous sound of laughter that bonds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person has a warm heart, your conscience tells you, you can trust them. The talent to laugh is a good element to have when you are meeting someone new, and spending time with your family. Last @DATE1, my youth group and I went on a missions trip to @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1. We would be reaching out to many new children as we held a @ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small @CAPS5 town. We picked up the children from their houses and drove them to the @ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come into their neighborhood with our straight serious faces in our big twelve passenger white vans, it would send out a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with crayola car paint markers and jumped out of the vans energetically with big bright smiles. We ran up to a house door, rung the doorbell, and asked the parents if their children wanted to come to our @ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these kids live in poverty and have gone through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them that we were friendly so they could open up to us and let us tell them about @CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes would always smile and twinkle. A lot of the children just needed love and we did so by laughing with them and making jokes to one another.  Assuredly, our youth group made a change in the children lives. Our @ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ORGANIZATION1, the town's appearance is flat like a desert, there's no playgrounds, parks, or places they can go to and have fun. @CAPS8 gave us the power to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @DATE1 to remember. @CAPS8 opened the hearts of the @CAPS5 children so that they @MONTH1 hear the word of @CAPS8. I honestly don't think we could have reached out to them if we had not been a friendly bunch. It just shows how important it is to laugh with one another, whether it be with strangers or your family. If there is no laughter within your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a sense of closeness that is lost. In commercials, there's always advertisements where families are around the dinner table, or at a restaurant laughing together. Not everybody has to look like that picture perfect family everyday, but when a family laughs with one another, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do so because they understand the situation and have respect for one another. Of course a family does not have to be related, it could be your youth group, your friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story on how he met his wife is like the scene in a chick-flick movie. My cousin, @PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental check-outs waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette comes toward him in her baggy snow pants and says, ""I can go down the biggest hill"" with the most flirtatious eyes and grin. Now, @PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl would walk up to him and bluntly say that to him. But @PERSON1 was mesmerized with this gorgeous girl and all he could say was, ""@CAPS9"". The girl seemed thoroughly pleased with his answer and asked him when his next shift was. An hour later, @PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. It turns out, this girl's name is ""@PERSON2"". Apparently, @PERSON2's friends spotted @PERSON1 first and told @PERSON2 the guy had a great laugh and he looked like a good person. They urged @PERSON2 to ask him out and get to know him. @PERSON2, being the daring one, agreed. @PERSON1's story proves the point that laughter is important. You don't know @CAPS2 @MONTH1 hear you and how that person could effect your future.  Laughter is an important element in your life. It brings out the joy in people's spirit, gives you opportunities to meet new people, and perhaps change their lives. It reflects @CAPS2 you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to be like ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter"" would we?"	22	22		44				5	5	5	5	4	4	5	5	5	5	4	4						
20975	8	" Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON1 did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin @PERSON1 turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" @CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when @PERSON1 informed me that he brought an @NUM1 firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	3	3						
20976	8	" Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It does not need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the one form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has @CAPS9 boundary.  @CAPS5 was the most taciturn girl in the whole school. In the mornings and during lunch, @CAPS5 would hide in the shadows hoping not to be seen by the world. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 asked @CAPS8 what @CAPS5 wanted to be, @CAPS5 would say invisible. People passed @CAPS8 by without even a glance, thinking @CAPS4 I don't see @CAPS8 than @CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone that @CAPS5 could talk to, or atleast get a smile from. However, how would I approach @CAPS8? Would @CAPS5 think that I was insane? I knew there had to be someway to get @CAPS8 to talk, or atleast smile. As I walked into school the @DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hullabaloo as always. Paper air-planes flying one direction and mouths going off in another. I was used to being shoved around and dodging things on my way to class. It was just the fun journey of getting to your @DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gawky self made it to fourth period, I sat down and began to look for a pencil. As I did so, I noticed someone pulling out a chair @DATE1 to me and sitting down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone sit right @DATE1 to me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this could be my chance. Futhermore, I began thinking of ways I could start a conversation with @CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of @CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was @CAPS8 signature. I asked @CAPS8 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 had drawn that picture. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said in very quiet voice. My heart was pounding, almost breaking free from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. ""@CAPS2,"" I began, ""I believe @CAPS10 are a very good artist. Do @CAPS10 have any other pictures?"" ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS5 said again, ""however, they are all at home."" ""Is there any possible way that I @MONTH1 be able to see these other pictures of your's?"" I said happily. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS10 would like, @CAPS10 are more than welcome to come over to my house after to school today and see them."" @CAPS5 said in a very joyful voice. ""I would be honored,"" I said. As we ended the conversation, the teacher began @CAPS8 lesson. @CAPS5 was really a nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait until the end of the @DATE1. When the school @DATE1 came to a close, we meant each other in the foyer. I could tell that @CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @CAPS2, because I knew that @CAPS5 was fnally feeling confident with herself; like a baby bird flying away from its nest for the first time. We drove over to @CAPS8 house in my mighty mule of a truck. I became very nervous as we walked to the front door. As @CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled of fresh baked cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I could not believe what was before my eyes. My mind couldn't make sense of it all. @CAPS8 mother yelled from the other room, ""is that @CAPS10 sweetie?"" ""@CAPS1 mother,"" @CAPS5 said back, ""I have a friend over."" ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 mother exlaimed. We enjoyed some cookies and milk with @CAPS8 mother and then we went up to @CAPS8 room. @CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful drawings that @CAPS5 had done. @CAPS5 told me that there was a story behind each one of them that inspired @CAPS8 to draw it. @CAPS5 asked @CAPS4 I have ever drawn a picture before. ""@CAPS9,"" I said, ""I am what @CAPS10 call challenged in the world of art."" We both began to laugh; however, we both began drawing a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked over at @CAPS8 picture. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then, @CAPS5 looked at my picture. It was a failed attempt of drawing a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then began to laugh hysterically. ""@CAPS10're clouds look like potatoes,"" @CAPS5 said. Then we laughed even harder and we continued to laugh for what seemed like an hour. Finally, when i left the house and went home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone that needs a friend. I also realized that it can be the most simple thing that can make @CAPS10 laugh; like a bad drawing. This is beacuse laughter is contagious and we all know that we all love to laugh."	20	22		42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4						
20977	8	" ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" @CAPS3 quote can be agreed by everyone on @LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @CAPS1 with a person you care about. @CAPS1 is something you and another person can do together with ease. @CAPS3 brings two people closer together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who knows how to make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing isn't going to be the main part of @CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept on rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for that perfect guy. In the @DATE2 I met @ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he always knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking on the phone a couple of times I realized that I started to have feelings for @CAPS3 boy. Whenever we talked he always had me @CAPS1. I found @CAPS3 very attractive. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @DATE1 there was a football game, @ORGANIZATION1 (two schools who are rivals). During @CAPS3 time him and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so we could watch the game together. I had previously told him how I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the track, @CAPS2 all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear ""I would never let you @DATE3."" I turned cherry red. From that day on he will remember me as the clumpsy girl who trips all the time. Now that i look back at the day I realize how funny that memory was. Looking back at embarrassing moments is always a good thing in a relationship.  @CAPS2 you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life together you have to make sure you like them for whom they are. You don't want them to change. The goal is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and crack some jokes around. I always tell my friends ""@CAPS1 is a great ab workout."" Which is true because whenever I laugh, my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends, and laugh about random stuff is always something I look forward to. If there is no @CAPS1 going on, then that means I'm not having a good time. But lucky me, I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm around them there is never a moment @CAPS2 I'm not @CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person.  @CAPS2 you meet a new person, would you rather have awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? I'm hoping we have the same answer, because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that @CAPS3 person will make me laugh and smile and not make me be thinking ""@CAPS2 will I be able to leave?"" @CAPS3 is one of the worst situations anyone would want to go through, I can say @CAPS3 from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at saying jokes, I use all my embarrassing moments and thats my way I have people @CAPS1. I don't get mad about it, I'm the total opposite. I laugh along with them. I know I'm clumpsy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can bring a smile to a persons face, then I'm @PERCENT1 fine with it. My goal is to be able to make people smile @CAPS2 they are down. So instead of cracking a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that has happened to me. Everyone is unique in their own ways. That's what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making others laugh. And once a guy gets a girl to laugh, that's the first sign @CAPS3 guy was meant for them. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @CAPS1 means that you are having a good time. @CAPS1 brings people together. @CAPS1 can brighten a persons life. So next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help you break the ice."	20	22		42				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	4	4	4

When ever I got sick or hurt I will allways laugh at a great joke and it made me feel a little better when ever my family go on a long trip we always made jokes and tease each other soon the trip dont seem that long at all. it's very short and you wish that it could of been longer. One night me and my family was going home from the store and my brother asked ""what are we having for dinner tonight"" ""hambugers"" she told us my brother kind of freaked out becouse we dont got @ORGANIZATION1's and my mom said all well and my dad then was in a smal store called @CAPS1 hopped in the car and started to drive home. ""I feel like having mexican food tonight can we eat at @ORGANIZATION2's tonight"" my mom asked ""no I thought we were having hambugers tonight"" he answered ""We have no @ORGANIZATION1's"" my mom laughed. Then my dad stopped the car and turned around ""why"" we all asked ""we don't got @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS2 has some chips at least"" then we all started bursting out laughing. Once we got ot the place and found a place to sit we were all talking and my sister bursted out "" look dad I can move the straw from just looking at it"" and she stared at the straw in the cup and everyone whent silent. I knew that it wouldn't move so I tapped the straw so it can move ""ha look it moved"" she was laughing knowing that she did not move the straw. my mom was trying to hold the laugh becouse my dad for a second thought she could move the straw for just looking at it. ""I can't believe I fell for that"" we finished up are meal and went home laughing and joking all the way.   Laughter can bring people together family, friends, even enymeys sometimes I laugh so hard that I could not breath so well. laughter bring fun in life and knowing that some other people have the same intrests and you @MONTH1 gain a friend you never know just like my family and the @LOCATION1's trip everyone laughs. When it snowed one day I graved my cell phone and gathered the neighbors and my brother and sister and went to the park together we had this idea to have a snow ball fight mixed with capture the flag. We all picked our bases and the type of flag that we want and then started the game we had fun playing we were laughing so hard that it hurt and soon before I relized it I was geting to know my nieghbor better after that day we talked to each other more and understood each other more the next time we have a snow ball fight I hope she is on my team and we will win for sure."	16	15		31				4	3	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3						
20981	8	" My cousin @PERSON1 and I are constantly sick with laughter, he is the funniest person I know. He is hilarious when he isn't trying to be. I believe that is why he is so @NUM1king funny. @PERSON1 is a hardcore alcoholic, he is always drunk or drinking. On the rare occasion that he is doing neither of those two options, he is the dullest, most depressed, angry unfunny man around. Give him a drink or two and watch him turn into funtime @CAPS1. @PERSON1 and I have great grand wonderous times when there is an alcoholic beverage in or near his hands. @CAPS5 is sort of an awe inspiring thing to see this transformation take place. He starts as this sad, depressed, sober caged sociopath lion at the zoo with so many of society's judgemental, sour souled, pittiful excuses for men and women pointing, laughing and sobbing over this poor lion. When one of these ""people"" throw a beer his way he'll catch @CAPS5 in his fierce, angry teeth and devour a @NUM2 oz tallboy of @CAPS2 in mere seconds-- can and all! He then stands up on his gigantic feline paws and let out an amazingly deep vibrato of a purr. His big, ferocious cat teeth then smile like a @LOCATION1 lion, as his sick, beastly, blood stained fur slowly morphs into the scaley, scarred skin of a man. As he is standing there with a goofy idiotic sh!t eating grin he shouts ""I @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @PERSON1!!"" @CAPS5 really is an amazing thing, I have seen @CAPS5 so many times and I absolutely @CAPS6 find a single word to desribe this marvelous reconstruction of a living creature. Then with drinks in hand we will continue to have a great night of unknown comical amusements. I guess you could say laughter is a large part of our relationship."	20	25	40	40				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5	4	4	4	4	4	4

My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk at that time and @CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose, that was also funny but gross at the same time. @CAPS6 was the sad one of the whole group that was there, we all asked him, @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 so sad @CAPS5 answered that @CAPS5 heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said that @CAPS5 would think about it @CAPS6 was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that @CAPS5 left and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS7's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. So an hour past and my friend @CAPS6 came back. @CAPS5 came and sat with us and yelled I didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, @CAPS9 happened I asked?. @CAPS5 said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly. Oh did she really say silly that's not I word i thought she knew, everyone laughed, no @CAPS6 I was just messing with you man don't get mad come on now. So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me, @CAPS5 left and all of us guys started laughing I thought that @CAPS5 was just but hurt and @CAPS5 would get over it. an hour past and my phone starts ringing and I look who's calling and it @CAPS6 s ex girlfriend. Surprised I answer and I tell her that @CAPS6 wasn't with us that I would tell him to call you later, I said that because @CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to me so I was like okay so we started talking and she is telling me that she likes me... I start cracking up in laughter. She got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing. But I told that it was cool that she did so I told her I have to go and we hanged up... I couldn't help my self i started cracking up again and so that's how my day ended in laughter and it was like that all day                                       "	17	15		32				3	3	3	3	3	4	3	3	4	3	3	3						
20983	8	" Laughter is an extremely important aspect for maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some greatly beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. The implication of laughter is also a great way to create new friends. It is my opinion that healthy relationships whether they be a friendship or even greater, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. I personally use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental element of my relationship with my father's side of the family. One specific example of how I utilize the essential tool of laughter in my family is to reconnect with members whom i have not seen in a long period of time. Laughter is a tremendous element of my relationship with my father's entire family, and small family meetings as well as full family reunions do not exist without it. Being that they are scattered across @LOCATION2, and very few live in the vicinity of @LOCATION1, visiting with these family members is a rare occasion. The most admirable quality of my father's side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter simply seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. Relationships that I share with individual family members can be observed in every family assembly as well. Just @DATE1 my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was set to be in @DATE2. This event holds a specific example where laughter was a predominant element of a relationship between myself and one of my family members. Not only was I to be the only guy there, but I was also to be placed at a table with my aunt whom I had not seen for over a year. Although we had always enjoyed eachother's company in the past, I dreaded an awkward reunion and sitting in complete silence for the entirety of the festivities. The day of my sister's baby shower inevitably arrived and to my surprise, I was nervous. I assisted with the set up of the decorations as well as the other amenities and found my seat. Within ten minutes of doing so, my aunt and table partner entered and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. However nervous I had been, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me by cracking a joke towards how I was the only guy attending the shower. For the duration of the party, all I heard was jokes coming from my aunt and the laughter shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as both family members as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected with one another and possibly had the most fun out of anyone who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party gifts, or simply enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and myself were laughing hysterically. on this specific day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendly relationship with my aunt."	20	23		43				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	4						
20984	8	"                     LaughterLaughter can change a lot in people,it can bring people together. It can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @CAPS2 your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and I. @CAPS2 your in a relationship or a friendship, @CAPS1 able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@CAPS2 you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that's even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  My best friend and I laugh all the time, @CAPS3 can just look at me in a way I only understand and I'll know what @CAPS3 means, and then we both start laughing @CAPS2 we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don't get it. My best friend and I are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. My best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship as in having a ""boyfriend"" or ""girlfriend"" one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @CAPS2 you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. That means girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad @CAPS2 they want to hang out with there friends.  The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. My relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it's nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  I think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. Just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends, cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. Normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did that once and @CAPS3 was not happy as all in the relationship,@CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything,@CAPS3 was afraid to break up with him though cause @CAPS3 would not have any friends,cause @CAPS3 made him her life.  Laughter can always make you feel better, it'd kinda like a healing process it will always be there, its just a matter if someone can make you laugh. Theirs people that can make you laugh and @CAPS4 and videos and family. @CAPS2 your with someone that makes you happy it is like you full of joy and enjoyment to be around them and you care for them and you feel comfortable around them. If you have struggles and get through them and they still make you laugh and happy you will know that they are the one your happy and can laugh around. Family always makes you laugh weather you don't want to or not, i love my dad he always knows how to make me laugh. "	16	15		31				3	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	4	4	3	3

One @ORGANIZATION1 we were out at @CAPS3 great grandpas house, and we just got done opening our presents, and in the middle of the floor was a @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 cousin @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was inside the @CAPS2.   At first we tried to convince @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was out side talking to @CAPS3 uncle. @ORGANIZATION2 didn't believe us, even though @CAPS3 dad was outside talking. @ORGANIZATION2 circled the @CAPS2, and observed the @CAPS2 and was convinced @CAPS3 dad was in it.  Then @ORGANIZATION2 started poking the @CAPS2. We were laughing because it was so cute that @ORGANIZATION2 thought @CAPS3 dad was in the @CAPS2. He kept saying ""I know he is in there."" @ORGANIZATION2 opened the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad was not in there. @CAPS3 dad walked in to the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started laughing too. Later on in the @TIME1 @ORGANIZATION2 was playing in the other room and wanted to show @CAPS3 dad the toy he was playing with. So @CAPS3 dad climbed in the @CAPS2 and we told @ORGANIZATION2 that @CAPS3 dad was outside. @ORGANIZATION2 went outside to look for him but @CAPS3 dad wasn't there.   When @ORGANIZATION2 came inside he looked in every room and could not find @CAPS3 dad. After a while @ORGANIZATION2 was standing by the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad jumped out and scared @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 screamed like a little girl and we all laughed really hard.   @ORGANIZATION2 was mad at first then he started laughing too. At the time @ORGANIZATION2 was only five so when @CAPS3 dad jumped out at him he got really scared. @ORGANIZATION2 thought it would be funny to scare @CAPS3 dad so @ORGANIZATION2 hid in the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 dad came inside and we told @CAPS3 dad to look for @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS3 dad called his name looked in every room and pretended like he couldn't find @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 started laughing because @CAPS3 dad acted like he was going to sit on @ORGANIZATION2 and it made him laugh super hard. When @ORGANIZATION2 got out of the @CAPS2 he was like ""how did you know I was in the @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 dad said ""well you started laughing silly goose.""   out of all the @ORGANIZATION1's i have had that @ORGANIZATION1 was the best @ORGANIZATION1 ever.

20987	8	"  While you being to make any kinda of relationship with anyone, you are usually going to start off making jokes and being silly. Whether your trying to be flirty with them, or just be the funny one and make a good, first impression. Usually all of these things lead to someone laughing; even if they really didn't have a reason to. Anyone who is shy around new people, will most likely laugh about anything they say. If it's someone you already knew, you could always be giggling about something. There are different types of relationships you build with different people and laughter is almost always the number one way to keep it together.   When you have been in a strong friendship with someone, you are already very close with each other. The laughing, crying, and fighting you do with that person, will make the relationship stronger. There are times that you spend with another individual that will makes steps towards sticking together. From my experiences, i will become somebodies close friend for quite sometime; then we will get into an argument and no longer be friends. Although we fought and wished to not talk, we became good friends again because of all the time we had spent laughing together. Being sad all the time, with no one else to laugh with, made us realize how much we missed each other. Even though meeting someone new was simple; it didn't last as long as the friendship i had with the other person.  Truly, when you meet someone for the first time, whether it's a boy or a girl, you will laugh and make jokes almost the whole time. That might even be how it will stay. Once you have known a person for so long, you can tell what type of relationship you will have with them. The connection you make with them is simple;you could get along, or you could always argue. No matter what relationship you make with an acquaintance, will most likely be the same all the time. When you are not as close with another person, you tend to not care about the friendship as often. You wont be as emotional, although your experiences you have with them could always lead to laughing. The time you spend with anyone should always be full of fun and laughter.      Another form of laughter could be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend. in my opinion, you will make a special connection with your other half. When two people have chosen to be together, they're choosing to spend their time getting to know each other on a different level. The fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love the you would have with a best friend. Couples should be enjoying their time together laughing, and making each other happy. Making each other laugh will allow them to be closer in friendship; becoming comfortable with one another. they will gain more confidence and ability, just by sharing the times laughing together.   The laughter you laugh with anyone, will build any type of relationship. Usually the first impression will identify the connection you have with that individual. There are always ways that you will act with one person and not the other. The three different types of friendship that are most common are; acquaintances, boy friend/girl friend, and close friends. All of the friends you make, people you meet, will involve a lot of laughter."	20	15		35				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	3	3	3						
20988	8	"  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless! "	20	18	36	36				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	4	3	4	4	5	5	4	3
20992	8	" So many people sing songs and write stories about sad depressing events, like it's the only thing life consists of. We seem to never stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and appreciate those little things, everyone would realize just how much they really have. In some way or another we all seek pity and for some reason we want to have the worse story. Like it's some sort of competition. I personally don't want to have the worse story. If you just ""go with it"" things seem more lighthearted, care free, and people would rather be around someone that makes them feel good and happy than someone that makes them feel sad. There is many times where I could have chosen to stay mad and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh, and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @DATE1 was the @CAPS1 dance. I was supposed to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (like always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out that it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents already drove away and they didn't have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at the school. While I was trying to get hold of somebody to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them that the dance was canceled. My friend's mom was nice enough to come pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @LOCATION1's and play arcade games. We had an amazing time! We all got matching rings and I got two lollipops. When we were done we went up to our friends house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way to much sugar and was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great evening full of laughing. I could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, all of us could have, but we made the most out of what we had and ended up having a really good time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dance would have been. Another example is when I was a freshman. There was one day that seem particularly hard. I felt like nobody wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting in the hall by myself, feeling like nobody cared. A senior that year came up to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me that it's harder frown than it is to smile. I realized that he was absolutely right. Even though smiling takes more muscles, frowning in the long run has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I latter regret, but if I just ""go with it"" it doesn't seem near as bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that have no sad or depressing meaning. Or a millions books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall down, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartaches, @CAPS2.E class, and of course laughing. Laughing also makes you live longer; so why wouldn't you laugh as much as you possible could?"	20	20		40				4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	4						
20993	8	" Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load lightens, @PERSON1 I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in myself is more evident sometimes than others, such as if before the miracle of laughter I was feeling overworked, worn out, or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @PERSON1 I am grateful that my days are filled with great friends @PERSON1 funny memories.  One of the things that must be present in any relationship is humor; you must be able to make each other laugh. I have had multiple times with my two best friends, @PERSON1, when we simply couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave feeling happy, with a smile on my face, with many good stories to tell. One of these occasions was @PERSON1's birthday party the @DATE1 before last.  @PERSON1 wanted a small party with just the people closest to her there, so @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I were the only ones invited. We live a tiny, cute town, however, there isn't much to do in the area of parties. Because of this, everyone ends up going to @CAPS1, just half an hour away. It was a blistering @DATE1 day @PERSON1 we wanted to show off our tans, so of course @PERSON1 started her party off with a float on the meandering @CAPS2 river. That's when the laughing began. Three twelve year old girls drifting down a river by themselves with a giant beach ball (early birthday present) that was promptly dubbed @CAPS3, what could be so funny? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is how we find humor in every situation when we are together. They thought it was hilarious that I have an irrational fear of seaweed (or river weed, or pond weed, or any type of water weed for that matter ) @PERSON1 that I would yelp or full out scream every time that some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @PERSON1 just couldn't hold on to her sandals, @PERSON1 would end up making wild dives for them as they floated away. We both thought the way @PERSON1, the @CAPS4 that she is, was reluctant to get wet was preposterous. @PERSON1, naturally, we pushed her in numerous times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, @PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friends @PERSON1 get away with it, but when we are together, I can let my guard down @PERSON1 can be myself. My goofy, irrational, apparently hilarious self, @PERSON1 still have fun.  Our laughter can even change how a situation is going to progress. For example, after we were done on the river, @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I went to @ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon of music @PERSON1 food. We all got enormous ice cream cones, the best money can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, @PERSON1 were playing with @CAPS3 a few yards away. I was just about to take another heavenly lick of my waffle cone when the @CAPS3 the ball flies over @PERSON1 knocks all the ice cream right out of my cone! I was left with a completely intact cone, but all of the good stuff was on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 hadn't started laughing. Maybe I would have teared up, or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was just so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they just couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysterics. Even through my disappointment I started cracking up as well, @PERSON1 then everything seemed okay. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other people I have ever met, @PERSON1 I suspect I will never meet anyone else that makes me feel as they do. This laughter we have makes us feel better. It helps us relax @PERSON1 let our guard down, so the times after we laugh together is often when we confide in each other the most. If one of us is feeling down, or is under the weather, laughter is the sure fire way to get them back on their feet @PERSON1 smiling. Even simply being with them makes me feel more exuberant, lets me abandon my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the the three of us. Whenever we laugh, our relationship builds. It is the good times we have had that help us through the bad times, @PERSON1 I know that our good times wouldn't have been so good were it not for the way we can laugh together."	20	25		45				4	4	4	4	4	4	5	5	5	5	5	5

But love is something that develops over time and brings people closer in the long run. Before you've ever loved someone though, you've laughed with them. Laughter creates conversation, mends relationships, and brings joy to people. Its an important part of any relationship and has certainly helped me make friends.   In the kindergarten, everything was new to me. I got to leave my house, go to school, eat lunch, and go to recess. There were many children just like me, bouncing with excitement as our daily routine started. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one around to play with.   One day after school, I noticed a boy walking around next to my yard. I walked over and remembered him from that school day in my classroom.  ""@CAPS2"", was all I said. He turned around, and with all his might, burped as loud as he could. We fell into a fit of laughter and I knew I'd made a new friend that day. From then on, him and I were bestfriends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with us laughing about something. There was no need for our parents to set up any ""playdates"" or scheduled time to meet other children because it was easier to laugh at something and make a friend naturally, not awkwardly while the parents chatted. From then on, making friends was a piece of cake.Through grade school and well into my teenage years, I had a best friend and a lot more friends, solely, because of a moment of laughter.  Laughing is something that can always ""break the ice"". Whenever you meet someone new, it's always kind of hard to just talk to them. You don't know whether to be serious, outgoing, funny, or quiet. But if something happens that makes both of you laugh, then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension in between. It's like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness, things just get easier and easier.  For many, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in every persons life and it can be hard to deal with at times. Whether it's a breakup, a depressive mood, or maybe even a death of a loved one, something funny and a laugh @MONTH1 help them get their mind off of whatever is bothering them. Most of them time that's all a person wants, something to help them forget what ever troubles them, if only for a few minutes. It's how people build better relationships, they do whatever they can for each other to make each other feel better.   Besides it's healing and conversation starting qualities, laughing is simply fun to do. It @MONTH1 start out as a small giggle, turn into a chuckle, and end up as a fifteen minute session of raging, side cramping laughter. And most of the time, you're with friends so they're enjoying the moment of fun and happiness right along with you.   If you've never laughed once in your life, there's something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, relieve painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant fun. Just try it, it's not that hard. I guarantee that it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and make you happy."	20	20		40				4	4	5	5	4	4	4	4	5	4	4	4

Not only would we get more upset as time went on, but my mom and family members got fed up. It didn't help that there was only @NUM1 months between us. It would make everything ten times more tense. My mom had a few tactics to try to get us to stop. One would be grounding us. But we shared a room so that would only make it worse. Another was giving us chores which took up both our time and was annoying , the last one was making us sit criss cross apple sauce, face eachother, and hold hands. We hated this one. But every time that we did it we would end up cracking up and forgetting what we were even fighting about. After we did this we would give eachother a hug and move on. The laughter brought us closer and always helped to fix things."	19	19		38				4	3	4	4	4	4	4	3	4	4	4	4						
20998	8	" Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,""@CAPS2 come here."" I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,""@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS2 always remember that."" I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity."	20	16		36				4	4	4	4	4	4	3	3	3	4	4	3
