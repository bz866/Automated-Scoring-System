       "\"1785\\t1\\tMy opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\""

       "['1610\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. It was extremly exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn\\'t go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don\\'t need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Proffessor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worriying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waist @PERCENT2 of there spare time on their computer. If technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is likey for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said \"\"I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. Its been quite sometimes when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. \"\" @PERSON1 later mentions \"\" it\\'s kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature.\"\" Not only is excersicing time headed down the drain, but our used to be \"\" beautiful\"\" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials there parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1. Since adults aren\\'t doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. The kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremly off the wall; our nature is going from beatifu to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official has survey @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and roleizing the beaty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoughly breathe in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minuests, a week. I mean come on; that\\'s pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won\\'t be nessicary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old an I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I\\'m always told I have a huge family that is very known to our town but I have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents stand me in my house as they use the computer. The other day I just found out what \"\"show\"\" is because my moms computer brake and now I am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom\\'s computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature? Its sadi how @PERCENT3 of these reasonings are caused by the excessvive use of technology and computers. Let\\'s just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!\"\\t5\\t6\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1611\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are very important to some people. Everyone uses them or has used them before. It isn\\'t bad to own a computer because you can still excersise and be able to do the things you do everyday. Lets say that you need to look something up, the thing you always go to for information is a computer. People in schools, industries, and in homes use it all the time. Teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games, I know I do. It\\'s so they don\\'t waste their time being bored all day. Excersising and being active is indeed very good for teenagers to really look into, but even though they do that, they don\\'t push away the computer. It will always be there when they don\\'t have anymore homework or when they finish running around the neighborhood with their friends. I can\\'t imagine what my life would be like coming home from soccer practice and done with my homework and the computer or @CAPS1 is one of the first places I run to so I can just sit back and relax. Computers should be known as our friends. They won\\'t hurt us. They just give us what we need and want. Reaserch is a good example because everyone uses the computer to find whatever it is that people are looking for on it. And if they\\'re done with reaserching they can have a little fun by games and friends. But I believe that the main purpose for computers is information. Whenever I get home from school, I finish my homework and stretch a little for cheerleading then whatch @CAPS1 or go on the computer so i\\'m not bored. It\\'s not that i\\'m not active because I\\'m not working out or excersising. It\\'s because I have nothing to do, so why not make my time occupied? Everyone does it so I\\'m not the only one. Yes, computers are just this square box with a keyboard, but if you don\\'t push it away from peoples common lives than you can see that they aren\\'t what you say they are and they won\\'t rot peoples brain or anything. The reason they are in an office or living room or bedroom is because people like them and uses them for their needs.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1612\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 do @CAPS5 do when @CAPS5 need to write a report? Or talk to a buisness partner, friend, or family? @CAPS3 computers help us do all of that. The eletronic wonder improves are lives everyday. Yet some people refuse to accept computers are now apart of every day life. Computers help us communicate, research different topics, and have just plain fun things to do. Computers make it easy to communicate. Things like \"\"@CAPS2\"\" and \"\"facebook\"\" let us talk with each other. Some @MONTH1 contest \"\"@CAPS3, use a phone or go out.\"\" @CAPS1 if they\\'re away on a trip, or live thousands of miles away? With computers everything is easier. Computers allow us to reserch topics @CAPS5 need for classes or work. \"\"@CAPS5 can get alot of detailed information from thousands of sites. Sceptics might ask the question \"\"@CAPS6 not go to a library.\"\" Some of us might prefer to stay at home. Another reason is, that it maybe snowy, or the library is closed. @CAPS1 ever the reason, computers make reserch fast and easy. Computers also fulfill a great need to entertain ourselfs. Games sites like \"\"facebook\"\" have become very popular. They can provide us with emotional release from the everyday world. A pontential argument might you \"\"@CAPS6 go outside?\"\" The weather could for bad and your sick. Computers are fun, education and a communication wonder. should find the good in computers and @CAPS1 they could do for there.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1613\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive affect on society because it gives a lot of information, it has lots of fun games and music, and it informs you about issues in the world and communities. The first reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because its gives you lots of information. If you need to do projects and research, what better way to do them than on a computer. You can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and people that made a change in the world. You can also look @CAPS5 and study different kinds of plants and animals, and you can find fasmating experiments to do. The second reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music. You can go on the @CAPS1 channel website and play lots of diffrent games from your favorite t.v shows. They also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your @ORGANIZATION2 such as comprehension clinic. The computer also has lots of music that you can listen to. You can listen to @ORGANIZATION1\\'s album. I am @PERSON1 before You @CAPS2 it, or @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 before buying the @NUM1 songs. The fina; reason I think that computers have a positive effect on society is because it gives you information about issues in the world. You can go on a computer and search @CAPS5 natrual disasters like @CAPS8 earthquake, @CAPS9 earthquake, or information about the tsunami that @MONTH1 hit @LOCATION2. You can search @CAPS5 @CAPS10 @PERSON3 and get information. You can search your favorite artist and see what their albums gonna be like or you can search @CAPS5 issues in your community. That is why I think computers have a positive affect on society because it gives information it has lots of games and music, and it talks about important issues.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1614\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are beneficial to our society for example, computers are very helpful to everybody. Computers alsi travel nows faster. And they can teach us new things. I am not saying computers don\\x92t have their downs, but, computers also have their ups. Computers are very helpful in many ways. They help people find lost fmaily members, and they help police officers find many criminals. Haven\\'t you lost soemone in your family, or haven\\'t spoken to them in years and always wanted to find them and get back in with them? Well that\\'s what computer are for. Aslo haven\\'t you been concern about the many criminals on the street, and wanted to get them of the streets and in jail where they belong but didnt have a way to do that? Computers  help. Haven\\'t you notice that computers are  help police many women in the present time? Computers  people in the , but they help travel fastre for example say you heard there was hurricane or tornado and you needed to find out how . All you have to do is on the computer and look it up. Also, there an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and the didn\\'t information to help you. You would just go on the computer and find all the information you need. COmputers are of many things for they you. Computers teach you alot, like hand-eye cordiantion. Think about it, you might on hte computer that, but it helps. If you yourself while you are on the comp[puter you would start to see that you are typing fastre and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now, then when you saw your first computer. Computers though, not only teaches you hand-eye cordination but it also teaches you of many wonder places. Such as @CAPS2 falls, rain forests etc. Now, dont get me wrong, @CAPS3 not saying that computer dont their downs and that people dont take advantage of computers. but, I am saying that they help society alot. They travel news fatser. Also they taught alot to people. So take my opinion into consideration. And think about how much computers have done for you.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1615\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a @ORGANIZATION1 who believes that computers have a positive effect on people for one computed help promote hand-eye coordination. @CAPS5 there is the fact that computers also help teach people about distant places and people without leaving they\\'re home. @CAPS6 computers also allow people to talk to each other via the @CAPS3. What would we do without computer! My fist reason why I believe that computer are a good thing is hand-eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye @CAPS4 you have to watch what keys you are using when typing, your brain builds a connection with your hand, thus better eye hand coordination, \"\"@CAPS5 there is the fact that millions of @LOCATION1 are in car acidents a year, wich @PERCENT1 are cause by the fact that the driver of a vehicle had to look down at the whey to make that they kept thier car. On that road, this being that they have no eye hand coordination, @CAPS6 I that it computers were in the of every person in the world there would be less acidents a year. Secondly there is the fact that a computer can transport somebody in there mind. to a distant and or person. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT2 of people surveyed can find information on the @CAPS3 faster than they can in a @CAPS7 there is the fact that a child of any age can use a computer to find the specific information it needs in a matter of seconds. @CAPS6 I have observed that children know how to use the @CAPS3 but not a dictionary or encyclopedia, @CAPS6 there is the fact that people can contact and talk to people through the @CAPS3 for one this allows you to contact a long lost friends. @CAPS5 there is the fact that you can talk to theme @CAPS5 @CAPS6. There is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your @CAPS3. How cool is that @CAPS9 reading this letter and sharing it to your company I believe that you should support my cause. This is @CAPS4 computers improve hand-eye coordination, link people to other people and places and @CAPS6 allow people to talk via the @CAPS3.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1616\\t1\\t\"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2\\'s, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, \"\"@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.\"\" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

But, luckily we have computers so I was able to @ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wodd or information on him and got an a plus on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade I had to do a project on @LOCATION1. I went on a computer went on @CAPS1.com a get lots of imformation and got on a plus. The second reason computers are benefitial to the society is because computers have educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 saids, \"\"@CAPS2 percent of the computers websites are educational. I also remember when i was in seventh grade the whole class went on @CAPS3. com and were able to learn math and have fun at the same time. Last but not the least, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. Theres a website calle myspace.com and it allows me and other people to talk online around the world. I asked my class and ninety percent of them go on myspace.com. On the other hand the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. Theres a website called @NUM1.com and it has shooting and killing games that are not for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty four seven. Now, you know my reasons, why computers are good to the society, they give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, have educational websites, and even allow people to tlak to other people online. What is your choice in these actions. \"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1618\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper I\\'ve come across this letter I saw about the technology of computers and how it\\'s affecting people lives. I think the computer is a great of learning. It\\x92s a new way to study and do other things to learn in a fun way. My opinion is when you have to for a test, quiz or anything if can become boring. I like to study in a fun way that will to my head and I want it when is the computer to have I learn alot from the computer when im at home. my mam & dad think i spend alot @CAPS1 I do sometimes but half the time im studing test. Now i would like to the time to talk about is mentally when you go to learn. Physicly preasure or everything to You can learn different as well just log on to this has to choose them. Lastly family and friends. Family and friends are important websites like @CAPS2, facebook, aim and @CAPS3\\'t that cool. Thats the beauty of computers and technology letting you do alot of things with only using on device. Thank you for giving me the oportunity to say my opion and what I think. I hope you take my letter and into consideration.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1619\\t1\\t\"Dear @LOCATION1 news paper I have over heard this debate on weather computers are good influinces on people or not. I am sending you this message to state my opinion on the matter and in my opinion I think the computer has very good efects on people. Not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments. There are many reasons why it has a good effect on people but the first and maybe one of the most important is it is an amaizing learning tool. When people are on the internet they could learn just about anything they want to on the giant mass of information we call the internet. It not only dose this but people learn how to do things through simulators from flying a plane to driveing a car. There is even more learning ability on the internet because a lot of people get home schooled on it through the internet and this @MONTH1 be an important part of their education because they might not be able to go to school because they are alway on the road or they move a lot of whatever their reason is. The computer is an important part in the invancement of the people\\'s education. Not only can people use the computer in education but it is used as a tool in many ways, lets say your making a movie and need special effects they will use of photo shop or you need to collect and store changing information like lets say you want to stack you can always or down on a computer. Even if you were a construction worker you could your blue prints with pinpoint accuracy. Another less important thing about the computer is it gives many people entertainment. Lets you come home your bored you have nothing to do play a video game look around on the internet, it is also an important way of getting their music and or videos. This also effects many buissness and if the buissness go under becaus people werent moving ther stuff a lot of jobs will be lost and that is the last thing we need. The government also relies highly on the internet. They need it to make plans, save soldiers, and comunicate with other countries. And last but not the least we have the fitness and wellfare of the people useing computers. All I can really say to that is it is their decision. If they get off they can and if they won to sit there and waste or \"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1620\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking if computers benfit society? I believe that computers don\\x92t because you can\\x92t get exercise if youre always on the computers and @CAPS2\\'s really hard to enjoy nature too. Another reason comuters don\\'t benefit society is that you aren\\'t interacting with friends and family. hopfully I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer how are you going to get exercise? @CAPS2\\'s proven that more than half of united states of @CAPS1 is over weight. Exercising is more important than using the computer and knowing that you could be doing something use that you know is better wouldn\\'t you do @CAPS2? Interacting with poeple is important to do because you can meet new people and if you don;t then you might learn to be shy and not make as much friends as you like @CAPS2\\'s true taht oyu can make new friends over the computer but @CAPS2\\'s not the some meeting them in person. Also if you do make a \"\"friends\"\" over the internet, you don\\'t know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I urge you to go out and meet new people and not on the internet. knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the poeple you like, wouldn\\'t you do @CAPS2? Yes you can play games on the computer but @CAPS2 would be ebtter if you play @CAPS2 with your fmaily. To answer the question everyone is asking I believe that computers don\\'t benefit society at all and hopfully I have encouraged you to believe this too. \"\\t3\\t4\\t\\t7\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1621\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, \"\"Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday.\"\" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn\\'t just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, \"\"in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it.\"\" Computers are also a great way to communciate it\\'s fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It\\'s even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " \"1622\\t1\\tThere are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors. Lastly they teach us hand-eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries @MONTH1 be inquestitive about where they came from. They @MONTH1 also wonder how other countries are doing goverement wise or even economic (stocks). All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. Also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuaracy. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate. Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. My grandma was in the hospital once and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was to young. Since the technology of webcams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay. Webcams are a could way also in discussions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. If you have a webcam you can talk to eachother on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not. Technology @MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and @MONTH1 be the best one that will ever be made. That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand-eye cordination. Hand-eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired. This is an important skill because it allows you to suceed in life such as having to write. This skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this well payed job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand-eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. however if you get a computer you must update it reguarly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye cordnation. Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would nedd to suceed in life.\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\",\n",
       " '1623\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people these days rely too much on technology. Everywhere you go you usually see somebody on a phone, texting, on a computer or plugged into an ipod. These people are not necisarily bad, but they are under the control of technology. Computers for example, are in the eyes of most people, fast, easy and fun, but they also pose as a problem. Even though it seems like everybody has a computer, not everybody does. Also people become way to dependent on such matchines that they can become addicted to them. Computers @MONTH1 also seem like they work @PERCENT1 of the time, but they can also be very unrelyable. Just off the top of your head, how @CAPS3 people do you know that use @CAPS4 or @CAPS5? A lot I\\'m sure. Now multiply that number by itself for all the people they know and multiply it again and so forth. That number shows that, @CAPS6, over @NUM1 million people use these. Now what are the chances that if you sent a friend a message one of these programs (with the @NUM1 million + people on is) that the server will be @PERCENT1 relaible and your pal recieves the information he needs? My point is that, what if somthing important came up that required your friends help, and you could not reach him because of a fault in the system? What would happen You could be at a hospital for a ride home for an hour longer than it should have taken. Another problem is what if you needed a computer, and you specially needed him/her? If they did have one then You have you did it in @NUM3 minutes but how else could you contact them? You could try to call, but what if they are outside and are playing with his/her dog? Also these days if you are really grateful for somthing you go on google and type in virtual thank you cards. If the person gets it then they will be happy, but probly much more so if in the mail they got a handmade real thank you card. My final reason that computers hurt us more than they help is addiction. Like I said in my first paragraph, everywhere you go you see somebody wired into an electronic device. People no longer go outside and play cowboys and @CAPS7 because now all they have to do is hit paly. I will admit I too use my computer quite a bit but at least I budget my time so I can also go outside and play a while. Obeisity also branches from overuse of electronics along with @CAPS3 other products.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1624\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 you know that computer have been around since the @DATE1. Ever since then, many people have had a better life. Computers really help the elderly out a lot. When they need to pay a bill, they could just log in, pay it and move on. Another thing is if they need to write a letter, but their handwriting isn\\'t that elegable anymore, they could type it, print it, and be done. This way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter. Computers are a fad that will never die out. Doctor @PERSON2 of the @ORGANIZATION1 in @PERSON1 said, \"\"The children I work with use computers everyday to build their hand to eye skills, ever since they have increased that skill @PERCENT1.\"\" The corperate from @ORGANIZATION3 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that everyone should have a computer. Computer help you out with projects and I think everyone should have one too. Are you ever sitting home with nothing to do? Well, why don\\'t you go out and buy a computer to play with? Computers can help you do all types of things. If you like to play video games. then you\\'ll love one of these machines. They have all types of game systems out there just for computers. They also have web sites you could go on just to play them. I\\'m sure most of you like to play games, so why not try it. A basic computer isn\\'t that much if your worried about the money. So go out and buy one. There is a lot of people in college now and mostly all of them have computers. They make research easier and faster to find. Which would you rather do get ready, jump in the car, drive to the library, search for a book, stand in line, and check it out, or, get on the computer, search what your looking for and be done? You make that decision. When college students get stressed which happens all the time, they could turn on music from the computer to calm them down. Computers have changed the world in a good way, and they continue too. You should buy a computer today.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1625\\t1\\t\"I belive that computer technology is a positive effect on people. I think this because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and talk to people online. Here are some reasons why. My first reason is because the computer can teach you how to type faster. For example, for the use of your fast writting you can get a good job/career and can have a future in your life. Another example, is because you can type e-mails faster and don\\'t need to type slow. Last example, is that you can improve you typeing skills and become a better typer. My second reason is because you can learn about far away places. For example, you can learn about other countries and how it\\'s different from our country and how their alike. Another example, is you can use it for projects, get all your information and be prepare for a great project. Last example, is you can always learn something everyday from your computer, like news, weather etc. My third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people. For example, you can talk to your friends and family to check in on them and see how their doing. Another example, is when your bored you can always talk to someone on the computer and have fun with it. Last example, is you can talk to your friends and plan when to hang out and go outside and get fresh air, That way you don\\'t have to be in your house all day. That\\'s why I think that computer technology is a good idea because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and allows you to talk to people online. I hope you agree with me also, and should think that computer technology is a good idea for everyday for lots of reasons.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1626\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have come very far with technology. Computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther. But the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society. My reasons for this are when you are on a computer you could be cyber bullied. My next reason is that when you stay on too long you miss out on stuff like being with family. The last reason why computers do not benefit society is when you type on a computer the spell check on @CAPS3 checks spelling and puncuation and grammar so you don\\'t learn from your mistakes. These reasons support me in saying computers haven\\'t really benefited society. Firstly, my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is you can get cyberbullied. For instance somebody goes home and checks their email. They get threatening emails. They are scared what do they do. Cyber bulling, being induced by computers, is the easiest way to bully somebody. You can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message. All you really have to do is find out somebodys email. Also cyber bulling could be anybody. Some one you knkow or someone you don\\'t. computers haven\\'t helped in society by inducing more crimes. Next my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life. Between checking email accounts and updating @CAPS4 the average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer. People who spend that much time on the computer miss things. My sister always come, out asking questions in the middle of the conversation because she\\'s following and updating on @CAPS4 while @CAPS2 are having a conversation. People miss things while on the computer. Lastly, when you are typeing an essay or something you don\\'t learn anything about grammar or spelling because spellcheck checks it for you. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1 when texting don\\'t use proper grammar or spelling. So they can write an essay in text language and when typing it over students choose what they mean from spellcheck and move on. This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling. This is reducing students thinking levels just above read and click the awnser. If computers did everything for us @CAPS2 would be mindless slugs quick. In conclusion I think computers have not benefited society. Computers inducieng cyberbulling. When you type spellcheck corrects your mistakes so you don\\'t learn and people miss stuff when on the computer. Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more. Computers should be used less.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1627\\t1\\t\"Dear local Newspaper, I think using a computer has become bad influence on modern society. When people talk to each other via text message or e-mail there is no emotional sense. You are blind a way because you can\\'t see who\\'s on the other side of the screen, @CAPS1 you know is the username of that person. Its practically the same as using a disguise. Not only is the computer dad for your healthy. Its become a threat to its user. Would you really want to use something that bad toward your health and your privacy? Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of teenangers have access to/and use the internet more than three times a week. Statistics also so that more than half of teenagers in the @CAPS2.S.A spend more than @NUM1 hours on a computers, some even @NUM2 hours! This has become the addiction of the world. My friend barely used a computer and always played outside. When his sister showed him @CAPS3, @CAPS4, myspace, @CAPS5, etc. He would stay on for hours and after a month, it didn\\'t get better, day after day he began to come outside less and less, and I began to hate him fo that. Statistics show that people who are using computers excessively tend to have drop in their grades. People are mixed in to these machines they become anti-social, don\\'t do homework, potentially fail the unit and reappeat the grade. Computers are the same as watching tv, sure! they teach hand to eye coordination but at the same time their brains are being turned into swiss cheese. I believe computers are the best idea, since pouring gasoline on pancakes. \"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1628\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach to people hand-eye cordination, and about places all over the world. Computers are also great for talking online to family and friends. Computers teach people hand-eye cordination. They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school. You don\\'t have to leave your home, you can even stay in your pajamas. Computers give you the information that you need. Or if your planning a vacation in @LOCATION1, and don\\'t know where to stay, then the internet will get you right there and give you great opptions. Another thing computers are great for is talking. How so you say, well you can got to A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with all your friends and family. This year my brother, and my closest cousin to me, went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and any fun places that he goes. So without computers I would practically never see my brother, or talk to him. Local newspaper please consider my opinion, I feel that computers benefit are society. They leave a positive effect on people in the community and world. Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact. Computers are also great for looking up facts for school when the library is not available. The internet also keeps me closer to my brother, whose in college, because we can chat and send pictures to each other. So please take my opinion into consideration. Thank you.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1629\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper, I am writing this better to explain to you how more people in our society would benefit from using computer you can do work in less time it would take to do it manualy. You can interact and make more friends by talking or web chating. Not to forget that it is more entertaning. That is what computers were made for. To help us with tasks or for our personal use. How do computers though help us with work? Lets say that you are having a buisness meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs. It would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer. With a computer, you can type you work which makes it much neater and looks more proffesional, You can copy and paste your images that you can @CAPS1 on the internet. With graph making software, you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest. If you had to do this by hand, you would have to write extremly neat, @CAPS1 pictures in a newspaper or mabe, even draw them. Then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up. It makes it twice as hard, to do a simple task with a computer. What if you want to talk to a friend? With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen. Instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them. If you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go. Being able to see the person at your convinience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have. The benifit are major and it doesn\\'t cost anything to chat. If you have a friend or relative that lives very far away, you can easily go at talk and have a video conference. What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable too! but we can fun, we can play games or watch videos at as convinience. They don\\'t cost a lot to download at all, they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself. Videos you can watch all the time with no ads to interupt you can pause the video too. This is more efficie, they care I very convinient for the average person. Playing games were ever you go is good and again don\\'t art to play or. In conclusion I think that people would be more from using computers this is because it is easier to work with. We can interact with each other. Use it for entertainment. Technology was made to make things easier do we should take advantage of it.\"\\t6\\t4\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1630\\t1\\t\"Has a computer helped you ever answerd hard question or type up an essay for school for work? I know a computer has helped me far years so why would I teminate it or want it gone. Heres the controversy, many experts believe computers don\\'t benefit society but people, such as myself, believe the exact oppositte. Their are many benefits to oconing a computer such as they\\'re always a source of information, allow you to talk online with others, and they can help people with their school and job loans. No matter what the problem, don\\'t you believe a computer is always a source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, have their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life he wondered the world with no hint or clue as where to @CAPS4 in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamon. He never found the diamond but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. due to a computer he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers they would find many things that they never thought of. also, computers give you the ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones, with a computer you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are a compute can always be on available form of communication. for example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old to probably about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don\\'t have the neatest handwriting so they type their essay or letter to their boss, you can even choose what type of handwriting it types. No matter the case, with work a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. Althourgh, some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addition. Still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1631\\t1\\t\"I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think \"\"well why doesn\\'t the \"\" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn\\'t the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn\\'t buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I\\'ve gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives @NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games. And lastly you want your daughter to go to yale or do you want her to fail. I have give yous you the facts the rest is up to you.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1632\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do believe that computers can be positive. If you think about it, they can actually help you learn with all those different programs they have. Say you need tutoring or advice, you can basically find all that on a computer even if you have a little kid with, I\\'m absolutly sure that they have websites and programs for them, and trust me they\\'re fun and educational! You know how people are complaining that computers are taking away time from exercising, and inteacting with family and friends? Well, what if you have family living somewheres else. You can chat with them! And also do execise while on the computer. I\\'m sure if you keep reading you\\'ll know why I think they\\'re positive. Having trouble in school? Are they blaming it on computers? Well we can change that! If we\\'re able to prove to people that computers can help us learn and are educationaly then people might actually think that computers aren\\'t bad with all of this technology that were coming up with these days arent that bad. I\\'m pretty sure that they have some sort of tutoring program, they even have college online! Now theres something to look into. Do you have a kid, a younger friend, or even a younger brother and sister? Are they always looking for games to play? Well I\\'m @PERCENT1 sure that they have fun learning games and websites on a computer! So, while the\\'re having fun, you can just think of how much they\\'re learning now! It\\'s a real fun way of learning! You can just imagine on what they\\'re learning and how well they\\'re doing on school. Do you have family who live far away that you don\\'t see much? Well if you all have a computer than you can posibily stay in touch! You guys can chat each other, check up on each other, and see how everyone is doing. It\\'s a perfect way to stay in touch. Want to know what would also be a good way to connect, a webcam! You don\\'t have to have one, it\\'s just a suggestion. So that way not only do you get to talk to them, but you can see them too. Isn\\'t that cool? I don\\'t know about you but I think so. Well now that you\\'ve heart what I\\'ve had to say about how I think computers are positive. I hope you think the same too. If you really think about it, they aren\\'t bad at all. They\\'re actually very helpful. Thank you,\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1633\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers affect our country in a positive way. Three reasons why I think so are comunication, @CAPS2, entertainment and, @CAPS3. One of my favorite things to do is talk and when on of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number I thought we had no way of doing it. One day he requested me on facebook and from there on we have been comunicating on web sites like facebook, myspace and, skype. My second reason why computer\\'s benifit our society is @CAPS2. At my dad\\'s house I do not have a television so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world. A website called @CAPS4.com was the frist to anounce @PERSON1\\'s death befor anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break rest on the internet. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, comunicate with friends. The last reason why computers benefit our society is @CAPS3. Many @CAPS3 in our comunity require computer skills such as a acountant, a manager, software designner, and a computer programer. The computer make @CAPS3 and more eficient by correcting mistakes, providing a visual and typeing. These are the reasons why computers affect our community in a positive way.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1634\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is great concern about computers and wether or not people spend to much time sitting infront of the screen or not. I believe that people should be more aware of the time they are in the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes you should be exercising, enjoying, and being with family and friends. Exercising is a major part of every persons life and if you don\\'t get enough of it you could become obeise. Obeisity @MONTH1 cause people to not like you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don\\'t care what others think, but in the long run it might be a mistake if you think this way. exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny joy, go for a walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny tots of colors forming an image of nature. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant \\'in person? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn\\'t you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would and I think most other people would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, nature, and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

This improves grades for children and life for adult solving a into the without leving your home and allowing news like yourself to spread into at the moment it\\'s known.

       " '1636\\t1\\t\"It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn\\'t be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren\\'t any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won\\'t need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. \"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

By using computers students can get there work done quicker and more efisent. While typing your report on the computer you might spell a word wrong well every computers has spell check. Also you @ORGANIZATION1 need to look up a word because you don\\'t know the deffinition all you have to do si go to @LOCATION1 and type in the word and automatically you have the deffinition. You @ORGANIZATION1 have been given a book report so you can go online and copy and paste @CAPS2 do @CAPS2 no @CAPS2 want let you but @CAPS2 you had a piece of paper and your pen you could write @CAPS2 down. A computer has made the life of a school student so much easier. You @ORGANIZATION1 need a job but cant stand, walk, talk well you could get a job working on a computer. Computers allowed more jobs to be made and replaced. Without a computer how would teachers get mail sent to them without wasting paper. Sure a computer uses electrisity but paper wastes trees. Anyway you think about @CAPS2 the computer is a good thing to invest in. Going to college not everyone has enough time in a day to drive to school, well with your computer you can go to school right online. So if you don\\'t have money to by a back pack you don\\'t need one your mates stay right where you left them. So a computer is a good invention. @CAPS2 has made life quicker, eco friendly and even has saved trees. On the brightside @CAPS2 has even produced many jobs. Last minute things can even be online.

       " '1638\\t1\\t\"I beleive that computers are helpful, and useful to us. They provide us with a wealth of entertainment, enable us to communicate with one another, and even help us learn. Today, if it\\'s raining outside, or its too cold to do anything, you can go on to the computer or the computer, you can watch movies, play games, and webchat. The computer is a grat machine, and health expert @PERSON1 sais \"\"computer usage is fine so long as it\\'s limited to about an hour or hour and a half a day\"\". Some people complain that people arent getting enough exercise because of computers. But its not really the computers fault that they arent excercicing. In todays modern world, you can call some one, text someone, or page them with computers though, you can do even more, with a webcam, you can video chat with people, and send each other videos. You can also connect with your friends on facebook or myspace. Sociologist @PERSON2 sais that more and more people are connecting to @CAPS1 websites, and talking with their friends. \"\"@CAPS1 websites are great\"\" @CAPS2 also said \"\"@CAPS1 enable you to talk with your friends when their far away, or you just can\\'t see them. However, nothing beats real connect.\"\" Computers also help us learn. They can answer almost any question you have, and have name a lot. Today, most people don\\'t . Some people still might think that computers are bad for you, and they cause lack of excercise, but I beleive people have the to make friends. They choose to over use the computer, and too much of any thing is a bad thing. Computers today are an invaluble of life, and are irreplaceable.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1639\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other. If someone doesn\\'t have a phone or car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives half way around the world @CAPS2 well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, friends/family, and places you\\'ve been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you search different topics and basically has everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on @ORGANIZATION1 and type in a word like \\'dog,\\' you\\'ll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and help find ideas. You name it; they got it. The computer also cames in handy when you have nothing to do. If you\\'re bored and can\\'t play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better, @CAPS2 well @CAPS2 keep you busy. If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained, you can go on @CAPS3 or other sites and find any song you want to hear. It\\'s better than listening to the radio because sometimes you don\\'t like the song that\\'s giving. If you\\'re also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document or if you just want to type whats on your mind. @CAPS2 you can see, I think the computer is a facinating tool to use. You can communicate, learn new things, and keep yourself entertained if you\\'re not able to do something active. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side. The second reason is the computer help you in your house for example: You have the big problem with your car or something like that. You can go in the computer in @LOCATION1 and the you see the pieces of your car. The thrid reason for the computer is so cool is because in this time you can make the everything thing.

Technology i needed in everyone\\'s life they realize this or not. There is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer and as far as advances in technology this is only the beginning. The internet allows people to learn-and more than just what you would get from a book at the library. You can learn about the culture of @LOCATION1, the food they eat in @LOCATION2, or even the way people dress in @LOCATION3. You can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country. The possibilities @CAPS1 computer allow you to do is research. When maybe they through them giving a presentation much easier! Furthermore the computer enables people to comunicate with others. For some, this is their only way of communication. If you have a penpal in @CAPS1 state, or maybe even @CAPS1 country, e-mail is a great way to talk to them it\\'s quick, easy, and enjoyable tool others, however, prefer instant messaging - the message you type pops up almost instantly on the others computer. Then they type a response and it comes back to you! Either method is a great way of communication!

But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn\\'t thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We\\'re all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that\\'s already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don\\'t know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you\\'ve worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration.

       " '1644\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe computers can be bad for society. My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers, less time exercising, and lose interacting with family and friends. My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them. I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on. It\\'s like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. Ive been over a friends house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. Alot of @CAPS1 don\\'t make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It\\'s because of the computer. Ive seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It\\'s just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends ive spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It\\'s like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think \"\"hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or myspce, or facebook! you lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer. Half the time im to busy talking to someone i don\\'t know then helping my little brother with home work, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion these are my three reasons why i think the computer is bad for sivilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think what the computer can do to @CAPS1 I people once again those three resons are one, people are spending to much time on their computer. Two, spend less time exercising. Three, lose interactions with family and friends.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1645\\t1\\t\"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @DATE1, computers are a big part of our society. They are an advance in technology, and they have some positive effects. However, computers have more negative effects on people. They take away and diminish @CAPS3 time, interacting with family, and seeing the world. First, computers have a negative effect on people because they diminish @CAPS3 time. People are so caught up with computers, their desire for @CAPS3 starts to fall. According to a @ORGANIZATION3 survey in @DATE2, for @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer a week (roughly @NUM2 hours each day) had an increase in cholesterol and slowly deterioating muscles. \"\"Computers distract people from their needs\"\" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. \"\"@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people get this amount.\"\" The leading cause for this low number? \"\"technology,\"\" she says, \"\"@CAPS2 computers, which take away all of the motivation and time people need to @CAPS3.\"\" @CAPS3 is vital, and computers are taking this away from society. People shouldn\\'t have bad @ORGANIZATION1 because of this negative effect: computers. Second, computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family. @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people say that computers take away from their family time, reports Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. This is not of all good, especially since @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and being. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to eat up time, it also cuts of communication, something extremeley important in graving children. with this, family bonds and relationship are ruined as wal. It affects interacting with family, and puts hates in family bonds: computers haved negative effect on people. Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world. When you\\'re on the computer, it seems like the entire world is in your computer screen. But its not. This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notedly become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net. The cure? Traveling, or even talking walks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of their world in which they live. They have to make important descions for themselves, their children, even their country, and staring at a computer screen wont help at all. It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, it takes away from people seeing the world, something actually very important because it affects people\\'s desicion making as well as future generations. People need to realize these bad effects, and majorly decrease their computer usage.\"\\t6\\t5\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1646\\t1\\t\"Computers have alot of impact on peoples life! Computers can be helpful and distracting at the same time. I have a computer, but I can only go on if after I finish my homework. I do alot of things on my computer mostly games and social websites like myspce. Computers can be helpful by helping you with homework or find information. I use my computer for homework alot like for project or if i dont know what the subject is about. I also think the computers are helpful by talking to friends or family. I talk to my family alot and they live all the way in @LOCATION1. I go on myspace like five times a week. Computers can also be a distration by making people lazy and have bad websites. Like myspace can be dangerous. If you tell someone all your important information and you don\\'t know them. That can turn out very bad. Alot of people dont even get off the computer. I have alot of family members that only get up to go on the computer or play video games. They don\\'t get off too. There on like for eight hours. My mom also uses the computer to go on @CAPS1. She talks to alot of her friends that she left in @LOCATION1. She still talks to the people in high school, but she mostly talks to her older sister. She\\'s not on the computer for @NUM1. She\\'s on like for @NUM2 minutes to an hour. I think computers can help in life, but not to be on for like eight hours. You\\'ll see what you will turn if you do that every. My cousins are getting bigger and bigger. I don\\'t mean height. So if you do go on the computer not for almost half the day! \"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Computers can also, @CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people. A lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end. Students sometimes go home and strayht oor tug computer instead of doing homework. Moreover, computers can help you pay bills. Do research, or maybe just for fun play games. There is an ulimeted number of websites & to cp on through to hep you with many of needs.

       " '1648\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their \"\"computer-time\"\". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you \"\"report\\' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you\\'ll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn\\'t like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren\\'t negative, unless you abuse your \"\"computer-time\"\" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it\\'s just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself.\"\\t6\\t5\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

This is true because people @MONTH1 not be getting enough exercise, people @MONTH1 not be enjoying nature to the forest, and lastly, because in this world, people do not spend enough time with family and friends. Computer are good to have around the house, but. To begin, people are spending too much time on computers. They are having more of a negative effect because while on the computer, you are not getting excercise. Think about the a day doing fat because of all the fast food on the computer while eating it. Obeseity now a days is a big concern with the @ORGANIZATION1. Staying on the computer does not help the situation. Any concerned person, technologically challenged would agree the countless ones on the computer are no good for the health of our country. Further more, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough beauty of nature. Many people, adults and have @DATE1 because they are world but there that should be explored and people should be thankful for beautiful that we have still @DATE1. They should be things wait to see it. Although communication is important for everyone, instead of talking on the computer, people should make plans with their family and friends. This idea also relates back to the lack of exercise and naivety of people. If people were to go out and enjoy life to the forest with their friends and family, there wouldn\\'t be numerous hours a day wasted on a computer. People should get off their butts and go. Life is too short to sit around all day. Any intelligent person would realize that computer time isn\\'t as fun as family and friend time. To conclude, computers are and have been very over-used recently. Instead of having problems, lack of sun, and just boring computer talk, people should got up and go. We only live once, and that once should be lived to the fulest!\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1650\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 would a person do with out a computer? Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don\\'t take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can\\'t because maybe they just don\\'t have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don\\'t have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don\\'t lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don\\'t @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you @MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It\\'s not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you @MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way. \"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1651\\t1\\t\"Dear, @ORGANIZATION2. A computer is a very helpful resource. It helps people navagate through life, they can find jobs, do research for school. This world wold be nothing without computers. But on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in thier research topic and wallah tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your finger tips. Also a computer can help unemployed people find a job. Its easy, type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also working from home can a lot less tessful. It\\'s less stressful because you dont have to deal with annoying and impatiant co. workers. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers home, @CAPS1 now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office, another day at home. Computers have helped us come along way since caveman times. Without computers this would will be nothing. We woulde have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even bleders. We also wouldn\\'t have the more sifisticated things like fockets. and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers, where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardys? On paper? Where would the goverment store their information? On paper? With those three palces we already cut down half of the @ORGANIZATION1. Computer help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on @CAPS2 or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Lets recap they help students reasearch, help people find jobs, you can work from home. Helps the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman. The @CAPS3 line is that computers are very helpful.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Instead @ORGANIZATION1 going to the store to buy things or walking to your friends house to talk, you would typically use the computer to do so.

For example, on a sunny and beautiful day you would think that most kids would be outside having fun, but this isn\\'t thet case anymore. For children who are old enough to use / work a computer, they\\'@CAPS1 be inside on that nice day. There are many nice things to do on a computer, like chatting with friends, checking your e-mails, and facebook. Even though these things are pleasurable, you should limit your time on the computer.

Some computers are also just for at home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @MONTH1 need instantly or wouldn\\'t be able to find any were. Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use but then does not mean they will permanently restrict you from othere activeties. It is true some people do spend to much time on computer but not everyone does, some people work from home computer and can not help being on it because it is their job. I implore you to consider the resonse computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help not hurt people. Computers are very helpfull in simplying things and are very useful for information. I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect hte way of human life. Computers do th things people would normaly not do for example someone would not go and look up every thing he or she needs to know in a look because there be only certain facts there looking for and it would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several diferent books.

Finally if people were not on the computer as much they would bring down the obesity rate of the contry if everyone just stoped using technology for a while and wen outside.

Finally, @CAPS4 is one of the most obese places in the whole world. People are sitting on the computer everyday, eating, and not moving at all and gaining weight.

       " '1659\\t1\\t\"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am here to talk about my view on computers, about how they help people, and how many people say that kids and adults are spending to much time on them. My first views on this subject is that computers are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on. These past few years, computer company\\'s have been making enormous strides allowing people to do allmost everything. This is both good and bad. A computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home. It is great for people who own a small business, you can easily go online and update somthing yoou want changed in your store, such as designing colorful posters to put on the windows of your store to increase business and to catch peoples eye. You are also able to book flights weeks or even months before you even go to the airfort. This is good for those who are busy and travel a lot. You can go on a website called @ORGANIZATION2 where you can go anywhere vin the world and zoom in on a landmark such as the great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1. Computers can also improve your hand eye coordination when you type. Typing is a important skill to master, if you are a good typer you can do things much more efficient then you would on paper. Some can even memorize the key board and not have to even look down. Computers are also great for communication if you have relatives far away in another state or even country you can easily talk to them through @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is a online service that you use to talk to them in person. These are just some of the things you can do with computer. On the other hand many say that people are spending to much time on computers, and getting outside for execise and not spending enough time with family. I do agree this is the case in some ways. I know some friends who average about six hours a day on computers which to me is to much, also parents become to busy with work that they are on computers, when they should be spending time with their kids. Some kids became so addicted to computers that they might become unhealthy and become obease from sitting so much, this is something that should not happen. I hope you have learned a little bit about the good and the bad about computers, and how it is important not to be on the computer to much, but it can be an important feature if used correctly.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

That people are speanding to much time on computers and not enough time outside and being with family. But I\\'m writing you today to tell you about how great computers really are. First off, computers help technology so much. People can now do things that we could never do before. Things like chating to people across the sea without having to pay for @CAPS1 or even be there. Looking up ways to burn fat fast and diet programs. Uploading photos to share with other family and friends. And much, much more. Computers have helped so many people do so many things! Mostly good things by the way. Secondly, computers have helped us acomplish things that otherwise we couldn\\'t have gotten done. Like go to the moon! Have cellphones! And some diseses were helped cured by using computers. Computers can be a little danguras to some people, who probley don\\'t know how to use them right, but in a few more years all that can be fixed! We are getting more and more advantsed in so many ways, @CAPS1\\'@CAPS3 kinda crazy! I could go on and on, on so many more things that computers do for us, but there are not enough pages. Lastly, @CAPS1 is more easyer to do reasearch with computers. -And quiker to- @CAPS2 in my school we use our computers for learning purposes, and they help us very much. I\\'ve personly, learned a lot from computers. I even use them to get better at math for the @ORGANIZATION1\\'@CAPS3! We need them! (@CAPS4... I do at least) I\\'m even starting to learn another language -@CAPS5- with them. @CAPS1\\'@CAPS3 not to assume that every one who uses them are fat, lazy, and don\\'t spend enough time with family and/or friends. Furthermore, please stop all of this nonsense, I really don\\'t thing that spending to much time on computers is the thing that you should be worrying about right now. That is all I have to say.

I believe that computers have positive effect on people @DATE1 because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to acess them. You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. Which is good because its much easier. For example im a student that can\\'t draw so printed some pictures of the computer so I can paste them on my post board. So in the other words the computer is useful for students. I know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or its a zero. In this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of intersting because you can up with friend that you haven\\'t seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantaes because you would have nvever thought you will see your friend doing. Another thing about computers that you can fint stuff cheaper than everyday lif say if you want to a trip and you call @ORGANIZATION1 for your ticket. The ticket came up to . But you go on the computer and you on @ORGANIZATION1 website and find your ticket to florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a restion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convince. At home if my labtop is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don\\'t know what to do if I didn\\'t have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to acess one! In this generation everybody is rushing and computers.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1662\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper, Computers are effecting more and more people in the society instead of helping. A boy named, @PERSON1 started to have many health problems afer he had bought a computer. The computer that he thought uses helping him wasn\\x92t any help at all. His health issues started to get worse. He soon started to be out of breath more always have a high blood pressure and he started to become overweight. Since he had this computer he didn\\'t exercise or got out to spend time with his family and friends as much as he was on the internet. Computers aren\\'t helpful, my opinion is that all they is waste time, lose your education and can make you unhealthy. As you @MONTH1 already know computer can do a lot to help you but there are some things that you don\\'t know about computers. According to a health magazine, tests shows that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose @PERCENT1of your brain cells. That\\'s a lot of brain cells to lose when you are going to need them for your education. There is no way to get those back, either. After walking around the streets to listen to what people think about how computers can effect people, @PERSON2, a policeman at the police department had this to say, \"\"I love using computer and going on the internet, but most of the time I act on he computer at @TIME1 and find myself getting off at @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1 can be very unsafe and unhealty. Computers can help you find what your looking for or show thigs that you have never seen before, but it is all a waste of line. Instead of going on the computer to go on facebook, youtube, or myspace you should go outside and interact with your family and friends after interviewing @PERSON3 the best female rapper so far she had this to stay \"\"Computers are okay but they are sometimes just a waste of time. Instead of being on the internet doing something pointless like playing a game you could be stucking far an upcoming test or doing your homework so that you wouldn\\'t be doing it at the last minute\"\".\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1663\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that people could use computers all the time and never get off. Well I don\\'t. Think about all the negative things that could happen. Like spending less time with your family, getting addicted, and unhealthy. People who spend all there time on the computer forget that there family is there. For instance, I remember when I was little and I was on the computer and I forgot that i had family members with me, so I missed out on all the fun things like going to the mall or park. Certainly, playing on the computer is fun but woudn\\'t you want to give some attention to your family. Almost @PERCENT1 of people in other countries be very lonely because all they @CAPS1 is play on the computer and forget about other people. You woudn\\'t want to be like these other people right? I never thought playing on computers could be addicted. Lots of people in other countries can\\'t last a day without playing on computers. Some say almost all the people that play on computers all day, day to night have died because they bairly eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. Imagine you life being ended because of addiction on computers. I remember when my friend told me, \"\"don\\'t be on the computer to long you might die,\"\" and I thought it was a joke. So think about going on the computer all day and night. Not but not least, some people aren\\'t treating their body properly. For example, some people playing on compters forget about eating, sleeping or walking around. This tends to make people\\'s legs num and make people\\'s stomach hurt alot. Imagine not eating, sleeping and walking around for a day. You woudn\\'t even want to try this. Now is the time to decide, wheither people should be able to play on the computer day to night. Also all the negative things that can happen like spending less time with family members, getting addicted, and being unhealthy. So get right up and decide.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1664\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn\\'t have one growing up, but I got one last year. Ther has been people saying tht the computer is good and it helps you stay in contact with friends and family it helps you learn about everything and you can look up the news. I totally agree with this. But some people don\\'t like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news. I am find out what weather is today, what happens throughout the day that @MONTH1 be shocking to everyone, and find out about celebrities. All this at a push of a button, and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a tutor. Either your having trouble on homework, or you just want to knoe a simple fact, the computer is for you. Just search up soemthing you want to know on a search engine and you will have your answer. This amy not seen that important, but it is when you are anxious to learn. Lastly, the computer is the famous way of communicating around the globe. Whether it\\'s facebook, myspace, aim, you can tlak to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, \"\"oh tha\\'s what a phone is for\"\"? Well all of these websites are free. Yeah, I said it free. There is also skype. Skype is where you can actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things. it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now your thinking, \"\"People spend too much time on the computers right\"\"? This is where independnece comes in. Get off or it. it\\'s your decision to stay on it, not the computers. Limit your time to a half hour a day. Go ourside, enjoy nature. AMybe do a little excercise. \"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1665\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn\\'t for computers, I wouldn\\'t be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don\\'t have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1666\\t1\\t\"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I have recently heard about many arguments based on computers ruining society. I strongly disagree with this. I think the computer is a great way to hook up with old friends. The internet is also faster for research than looking in a book and there are many games on the internet. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Some people have moved away and I haven\\'t been able to talk to then. Now, with the internet I can able to talk again. The same case with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she ever talked to. Now, with facebook she has re united with them. This also helps because you can email someone interested of sending a letter in the mail, which costs money, unlike email. So the internet can also be a way of saving money. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter. The internet is a great way to keep intouch with friends and relatives. I also believe that the use of computer is more efficient than doing to a library and researching a book. If you don\\'t have enough time to go the to a library, you can do some research at your house. What if the library is closed if you do go, then you wasted some time. The internet never closes, it is open @NUM1. What if you go to the library and they are open, but do hot have a book on your subject? This can also be done on the internet because there is any thing you could ever ask for on the internet. If you have an over due library book you can renew the book on the internet. The internet is a great place research on any topic you have or doing what ever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing about every game, there is that you would feel like playing. Also @CAPS1 of spending about @MONEY1 on an x-box and a game, you @MONTH1 only have to spend about @MONEY2 on a game that goes into your computer. There are also many websites that have games on them. Some websites are for specific games, and same have many games on them. Only a few of the games are interactive with other players and you can talk and make new friends. On the other hand, many games are only for one player. As a result, a computer is a great use to play games. In conclusion, I believe the computer is great need for our society. In the long run it will pay off, especially with the economics problems our country is having now, by helping us save money,. It will also allow connection with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1667\\t1\\t\"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Which article title more interesting, \"\"Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race\"\" or \"\"Local @CAPS1 wins three mile race on computer game.\"\" @CAPS3, the less interesting title is what your news will change to if people keep using computers. Some effects computers have on people use cheating an less time with family and friends and lastly, most people aren\\'t learning anything while on the computer, they\\'re just plaing games. As you can see, I agree that computers are a bad idea. I bet some people have never thought of this but computers can lead kids, and maybe even adults, to cheating. There are websites on the internet where the user just types the question in, and they get an answer. There is @CAPS4 another way of cheating, copying others work, essays or articles form a website. Some students could be told to write a biography on a person, and they could just copy an article, switch some words around to make a sound like their own paper, and with no guilt. Another can people computer spend less time with family and friends I was watching television and playing on the computer. The wife was very close to because spent the computer helping @CAPS4, there can was always in the on the computers. Because this show I realized that computers kinds anti-social divorce between parents go up. Do you see all people computers looking up facts about things as going on the computers learning. I know that when I have time to go on the computer, I am not looking up things to learn. Most people these days dont care too much about learning about countries, other than their own, or people, other than people they know. I think it\\'s pretty obvious that noone is going on computers to learn, otherwise they wouldn\\'t have so many users on game websites. In conclusion, computers have negative effects that get to all people. So, @ORGANIZATION1 you want to have your news be the latest divorces and computer game high scores? Or do you want interesting news that will keep you newspaper going. Thanks for taking the time to read this.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1668\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing. The computer is one of the top uses by @CAPS2, but I think we spend a little to much time on it. My reasons are, kids and adults spend to much time on it, cant interact with friends or family and you cant enjoy nature. Dont get me wrong, its nice to meet new people on the internet and learn about other places. But when are you going to get your exercis of your on it for @NUM1 hours? Sometimes you can never get up because your eyes are stuck to the screen. As for food, you sit and eat junk food. You cant get a healthy meal if you eat chips & candy for hours. Instead up being blinded by the screen, you can get blinded from the sun outside by riding a bike. Its a great way to get fit, rather than typing and clicking away at your @CAPS3. Another way of getting fit, (than to sit) is going out for a run. Kids need about @NUM2 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs than your newest download? You work out your arms & your legs! My next reason why spending time on the computer too much is bad is because you wont have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while your family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishies will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all wont you miss your friends? At this age kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the most simplest; enjoy nature explore the outside instead of living on the inside. Its good to go out once in a while and get a breathe of fresh air. If you havent visted the park in a while it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. Your getting exercise & exploring nature too. While your at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows instead of buying games online, your buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just dont spend hours-upon-hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take the considerations in hand. So try to get exercise, hang out with your friends & family, and enjoy nature!\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1669\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don\\'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1670\\t1\\t\"Do you like learning about faraway exotic land and animals? Are you good at sports but would like to be even better? Do you ever miss your family that lives in other states? The computer can help you with all of this but is @CAPS1 bad for you too? In my opion kids and adults should use the computer. When people are on the computer they can learn about interesting far away lands. When your on the computer you can look up some of the natural disasters. For example people could google each quakes and learn all about the people that has lost their life\\'s. The people that they will donate some money to the poor. Children living on their own. They can also learn about all the wonderful beautiful lands that are out their waiting to be explored. Everyone I know likes to the beutiful birds and animal. In their the world, They will be able to do this on computer. The might be so more this lands. Having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get. With having a computer people will be able to talk to their family that live in other states then them. I have a uncle that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see him because a lot of money to come. Somewhere on the computer, @CAPS1 is easy to just send him a message that say how I\\'m doing. With computer you will be able to talk to your friends cant talk on the phone. For example, what if your friend and did not. She can not talk phone because so what do you do you. This help you her. The last reason why we should have computer. If you let @MONTH1 periods of time then @CAPS1 will help you with hand eye coordination. This will help the kids that play baseball. They will know where the ball is at all times is they will most likely cauch the ball more often so playing a a little bit of video games is not bad for unless one. Using the computer is @CAPS1 good to do or not using the computer helps people be able to interact wild people that so easy to talk to. So @CAPS1 you are compleatly agenst using computer the get up and use @CAPS1 right now.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1671\\t1\\t\"@CAPS8 more and more technology is being invented, people use the computer to do work and to learn. But more time on the computer is not neccessarily a good thing. People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise. Take my freind @CAPS1 for example. He was a triathlete, who trained everyday so he could be in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1. But then he got his computer. @CAPS1 had suddenly lost interest in exercise and spend his whole day checking his e-mail instead of training. But he is not the only person who has become unhealthy because of computers. Experts say that @CAPS5 with computers at home get only @PERCENT1 of the exercise @CAPS5 without computers get. @CAPS5 with computers also were more likely to be overweight and choose chips over an apple in a study performed at @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1, who headed this study said, \"@CAPS5 are taught by society that computers can do such wonderful things and educate them. However, they are not taught how bad they can be for you health when used too much.\" @CAPS6, computers are a problem to our health. Another reason computers are a problem is because they strain you eyes. When my school had disabled people come and talk to us @DATE1, there was a blind lady named @PERSON5, who lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spend too much time on her laptop. But she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers. Scientests at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One of these scientist, @PERSON3, reported, \"@CAPS8 more people begin to use the computer, more people seriously hurt their eyes or even lose their vision. We estimate @PERCENT2 of this next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3.\" @CAPS9, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. A third reason people should not use computer is because they stop interacting with real people. My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. That is, until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven\\'t seen or talked to him in almost a @DATE1 because he has created a new family on the computer and spends the whole day pretending he is a @CAPS10 an fighting dragons on the internet game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that @PERCENT3 of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor @PERSON2 had this to say about how this is affecting @CAPS5. \"Too many @CAPS5 are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. They stop caring about school, sports, even their friends. It\\'s alarming!\" @CAPS12 reason could you have to use a computer after learning how bad it is for you and your @CAPS5! Computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity. They are extremely dangerous for our health. They cause us to stop exercising and gain weight, permanently damage our eyes, and deny us of the proper socialization that all people need to be happy and health.

With websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, people can keep in touch. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. \"\"@CAPS6 patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me now if they think something\\'s very wrong with them.\"\" say\\'s @PERSON1. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don\\'t have to worry about running up your phone bill. you can just @CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hours worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How @CAPS3 feel if no one called and told you your bestfriend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You\\'d be extremely upset. I know I @CAPS3 be with email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn\\'t know hoe to tell you, they could email you. It\\'s so much easier than telling a person that their.mom died by email them by phone. To hear pain in a person\\'s voice will make you want to cry. You feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today\\'s society? You can\\'t blame computer\\'s for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person want\\'s to be lazy, then that\\'s their decision. you shouln\\'t go around blaming pothers and things when its no one else\\'s fault but that persons.

About @PERCENT1 of people do this and it\\'s not healthy. @CAPS2 people do this too often, then they will not get enough excercise and without excersise then they won\\'t be healthy @CAPS1 they get older. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said \"\"@CAPS2 adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @NUM1 hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @CAPS2 adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it\\'s to early for kids to be unhealthy.\"\" I also agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1, she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don\\'t care about nature, @CAPS1 people do this, I can\\'t stand it. Its like they don\\'t care about anything else. What I don\\'t get is why can\\'t they go outside and do something for at least a half hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. You could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand @CAPS2 its a bad day like @CAPS2 its snowing or a thunderstorm and you can\\'t do anything outside, then you go on the computer. I think that at least @PERCENT2 of people would try this. Third, @CAPS2 people are too busy on the computer then they won\\'t be able to hung out with friends or family. @CAPS2 your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. But you can\\'t because your on the computer, she would be furious at you. You picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There\\'s probably a @PERCENT1 chance she won\\'t ever talk to ou again. and I don\\'t blame her. People who spend to much time on the computer, would barely understand whats going on. @CAPS2 someone tells you something, it goes in one ear and out the other. @CAPS1 people do this, its really dissappointing because you dont hang out as much as with your friends and family. As you can see, people are spending too much time on the computer than excersing, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. @CAPS2 you ask me, I don\\'t play on the computer as much which is a good thing.\"\\t5\\t6\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way. The computer is like a addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. I dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Every were you look theres a computer. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? \"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

They are now always inside on their computer. I know a thirteen year old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for miners, is a huge risk. You don\\'t know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You\\'d be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn\\'t even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fastfood restaurant. You don\\'t exercise, all you do is eat andt talk, but now all you do is eat and on the computer. I have met a obese child. @PERSON2. He weighs three-hundred pounds at the age fourteen. An eight grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounder by junk food. He never exercises or take a break. His report card is unbelievable. He used to be A @CAPS3 student. Now he\\'s in a dump. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2\\'s, mom says \"\"he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junkfood.\"\" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese there days. It used to be about jobs, but now it\\'s about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles @MONTH1 not be who you think they are. Especially, miners who lie about their age. They\\'re the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get a way around. They can use someone\\'s name and be underover. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that\\'s how our young girls, and boys, gets kidnapped, rapped, and end-up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days, are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it\\'s a way they get kidnapped. Don\\'t allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun.

The people don\\'t turn off their computers to just go get some exercise but just sit there staring at the @CAPS5 and messing up their eyesite. These people need to learn have the will power to get off the @CAPS5.

Almost @PERCENT2 of teens get kidnapped because od giving their @CAPS3 a way to stranger and @PERCENT3 of those teens don\\'t get found. The @CAPS5 is also a place of where a child or teen @MONTH1 get cyber bullied. Cyberbullying is harrassing children or teens on the internet, when children under or over @NUM2 get cyberbullied they sometimes suffer through a deppression and don\\'t tell their parents about it. Six months ago at my old @CAPS4, there was a volunteer at my @CAPS4 talking about cyberbullying and how he got so depressed because of the harrassment, that he commited suicide. The @CAPS5 is not always a safe place to be on. Finally, your brain more smarter than the @CAPS5.People can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on the their computers because your brains are like computers. About @PERCENT1 of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life. The brain is like a @CAPS5 because you can store information and nobody can hack into it.

Last year, a computer helped diagnose a concussion of mine and helped figure out I\\'ve had @NUM1 others. Not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human. An expert says \"\"Computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, @PERCENT1 better than doctors.\"\" @CAPS2 the social netwowrking has a positive aspect. This has let people, who haven\\'t seen each other for a long time, reconnect and become good friends again. With the positive aspects there is always a negative.

In addition, if we become has reliant of computers @NUM2 diagnos, what happens when they get faulty? These are problems that are very real and aren\\'t being with. If we cant deal with these problems first then computers will turn out to be a bad thing. Lastly, a moderation could be extremely helpful for us today. For example, instead of using social @CAPS1 for friends next door, go outside and play wiffle ball with them. Social @CAPS1 was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street. @CAPS2, instead of totally reling on computers to diagnose problems, have them and the doctor find out. Doing this will get great results and keep doctors prepared if computers, dont work. These are just a examples how moderation could be very helpful to everyone.

Eye protection is important. Although computers are hurting them by, the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes. Also if you look for too long it could make them tierd. I can tell you from personal experence that glasses are un-cool and some people get picked on for it and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you can see as well as you did befor. It\\'s glasses or even going blind. Vertual harrasment is another thing to be aware of. Over the @CAPS2 you could be cyber bullyed by kids you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not know. For example, one day you could be on @CAPS3 and be talking on a chat room and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or even just plain remakes. Witch brings me to the, sexual harrasment. Sexual harrasment if extreamly can make people feel usually bad selfs. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding there rase, there gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra percaution when seeing sexual harrasment. Sexual preditors are a parents biggest fear to kids. Sexual preditors are everyware, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS3, or even your neibors and wile kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do there extreamly un-safe.

Plese read on to find out what i have to say about computers. Using a computer has a of down falls but @CAPS1 of which is the lack of exerizing while on the computer. As you @MONTH1 know that many countrys are becoming obese because the lack of exersize. Computers are no help to this problem. The only exersize computer contribute is the hand and fingers but even that is bad because if you are typing and on computer for too long you will get carpeltunlye in the fingers and hands. @PERSON1, an expert on health, said \"\"@CAPS1 in three people go on the computer for more than @CAPS1 hour a day, which could lead to obesinty.

On a computer its imposible to enjoy nature because all the computer is is a time consuming brain washing thing to do. Nature helps save the brain. Without that then you\\'ll be very exausted all the time. Did you know @PERCENT1 of kids go outside every day that means @PERCENT2 of kids are in side on the computer. This leads to my finally topic. The computer @MONTH1 have sites where you can talk to friends but that is no where as good as seeing them in person. Your family is important so you need to spend time with them.

With computers there would not be any time with your family because everybody will be on the computer playing games insted of spending time with you family.

       " '1687\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people, think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. Tere is video-chatting, e-mail and chat websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer if you are web-chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as @CAPS2, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to @STATE1 and had to leave all my friends behind, the computers has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn\\'t want to. I can e-mail my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on @CAPS2. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to @LOCATION1, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said. \"\"Computers just make @CAPS6 all of the information I need to knew about your brother\\'s diabetes so easy.\"\" @CAPS6 information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made @CAPS6 information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won\\'t take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn\\'t make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people stayin touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that needed, and they make our school lives aint easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

My concern is that they haven\\'t been exercising much, they arent enjoy nature and they aren\\'t spending much time with their family. This is not a posiitve way for their life. In my opinion excercising is a very, very, very important thing to do. This is because you need to mantain a healthy diet to stay healthy and you need to excersise. Some people I know don\\'t exercise and they are either overweight or not healthy. People are \"\"busy\"\", as they say, uisng the computer to do all there work because they just don\\'t like using the old fashion way, which is going to your job and doing your work. Everything is different now and people have become lazyier than ever before. Would people be lazy, if computers weren\\'t around? Of course they wouldn\\'t be. They would have a happy healthy life. Now-a-days, people don\\'t go out and explore the world much they just go online and nthey search a place up on a google. They don\\'t see the real thing though. they see pictures and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way, way better than looking at a picture. But i guess everyone forgot about that. Computers have everything online, no wonder poeple don\\'t want to leave their homes and if they do leave, don\"\"t worry they have a laptop with them. Computers are even portable go wherever they go their still going to go online. Poeple have also spent less time with family because they could talk to them online in a s chat room. This isn\\'t a good thing because what if you were talking to your \"\"mother\"\", well at least you think is your mother but is someone else and your talking about your, I didn\\'t know, something private and that person on the other computer, \"\"your mother\"\", will know about that and can cause problems with you. You know waht I mean? Like if you were talking about your credit card and that person asked you for your credit card number and you gave it to them then they could cause problems. Online isn;t a safe place, thats why you should talk in person not on a chat room. Well I hope that you put my letter in the newspaper for people could exercise, see the nature and be with family, like they were when they didn\\'t have computers around.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurder/kill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralized from lack of exercise or get lumf ophemia thats when your body a pears and will not be a to exercise and would need special treatments. Like masogise. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand eye coordination by useing the still looking sometimes some people for useing the computer: videos, video, and websites. You can get your computer uloaded for for quality. Some systems howe computers in them or can be connected to the computer like the, and the @CAPS1 @NUM1 @CAPS2. There are games called p.c. games some p.c. games comeucicate with childern to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also spiecal computers and/or web-sites you can search for tutorial for speaking different langueges. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instroments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptynis inside of them inistead of eating. Some people obeuse the compeuter as a dug like they\\'re addictied to it. Imagine someone addictied to computers every where he/she goes they would take their laptop with them. Many people have died useing the computer but thats because they obeused it. Everyday people buy computers this invention is very helpful as time goes on sciantists are makeing new things to save llives.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

They wonder down the hailway and open their @CAPS2 book air to check the weather for today. They go on @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, and etc. to view their e-mails sent from work friends, and family. They check the time on the bootom of the laptop screen and lag onto to play some they are getting ready. Society today relies heavily on computers and the net work their keeps us all connected... the incorect with technological advances happening today, people are now using computers to help with their work. But is that a some @MONTH1 say that it is due to the fact the amount of spent on the computer is the much and that it stop from with friends but it does computers help with the skill of typing, help with fast end easy and helps friends and @NUM2. of through @NUM2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc I believe that computers have a possitive affect on people and once a great addition to society. to begin, computers help to reach @CAPS6, children, and even adults the skill of typing. Statistics show that more and more jobs on computers and hire people with a higher words per minute ability with almost @PERCENT1 of adopting new computer and using computers to store information to their company, computers are necesity and so is the knowledge of understanding computers and being able to type. Moreover, @CAPS6 these days are depending on computers for research to order to do projects and information I can personally connect to this because being a student on @LOCATION1 school, I am assigned project what involve typed words and or information. how hand it would I had to hand writs all of my work and on the for information. @CAPS1 multiple @CAPS6 are assigned the same project, the does not millon @CAPS6 to check looks out @CAPS5 there was no computer to use, what would I do? for @CAPS6, computers and a great thing. Furthermore, @CAPS6 and even adults enjoy social time, but @CAPS1 friends are family line faraway or you are not able to visit three, the computer connect in handy computer help to keep friends and family connected through @CAPS3, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 / or @NUM1, I.M / @PERSON1, and webcam video chats. All of those computer related things would not there for @CAPS5 there were no computer. Would you want no be disconected from family and being social is a key part of being You why shouldnt we keep them and why with all of these possitive things about computer would ever make you doubt them? In computers are wonderful things. They he is to build skill of typing, help and it easy, and also help keep and family connected. Computers affect people only good ways and help everday life be easy. so, believe that computers are a great thing and that without them, even just talking to family could be jeaporadized. Lets keep computers\"\\t6\\t5\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1692\\t1\\t\"Dear The @CAPS1, People have been saying that computers are not beneficial, but they are wrong. In my opinion computers are very beneficial. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places, also, you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand-eye coordinaiton? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type. Without having to lock down at the keyboard. Even if people don\\'t have the program they can learn how to type fact without having to look down. Many people that I know, have learned how to use the computer or type without anyone telling them hour to do so. Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. If you go on the internet you can go and searching person or place and the computer will find it for you. Children and adults need computers because if for example, a child get a project from schoool that need to be done about a famous person or smoking. she would most likely need to go to the internet . The game goes for adults that love jobs in offices, schools or anywhere else. Computers are essential to people all around the world. Computer can be used to comunicate with each other. People use computer to communicate with friends or family in far away places. They can communicate via e-mail, @CAPS2, video and maybe even in other web sites. Some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. Why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer? Computers can be used to learn hand-eye coordination, and help you move your fingers faster. They give poeple and places in the world. Finally, they can be used to communicate with one another through e-mail, message and many other ways. In my opinion, computers are one of the most important things to a person.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1693\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper, Have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight? Well its true. People say that it is because of eat a lot of fast food but I think that since we are always on the computer and not excersing helps contribute to it. Also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. Sitting infront of the computer isn\\'t going to help our environment. Lastly, kids aren\\'t getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. @CAPS1 not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way limit it. To start on with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. Some @MONTH1 say that people chose not to excerise but if we limit things then they won\\'t have to chose. As a kid myself, I love to be on the computer. My parents are always trying to get the computer and take the dogs for a walk and I always say \"\"@CAPS1 busy\"\" @CAPS2 its true, I don\\'t really like to go outside because I have a computer to play games or talk to friends and to be honest excersing to me seems important but I don\\'t do it because I\\'m always on the computer. I think that other people could feel this way so thats why we need to limit the computer. Secondly, global warming is occuring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer then go outside and enjoy the nature. @CAPS2, you @MONTH1 be able to look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? Some @MONTH1 not because they could just stay on the computer and keep \"\"@CAPS3 up\"\" ways to help another things is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming so it we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. Lastly, internet sites like myspace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. When we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they can\\'t. Also interacting with your family and friend @MONTH1 let you go in new places that you haven\\'t been before and on the computer you can\\'t go there. Interacting with friends & family is better than talk thru the computer. In conclusion if we stay on the computer then we won\\'t get excerise enjoy nature or interact with friends. So we need to act now limit compute usage!\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1694\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise. Don\\'t get to enjoy the nature around them, and they don\\'t get to interact with their family and friends! If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer, then they wouldn\\'t be having too many issues. People need to spend less time on computers, and spending more time exercising! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands. You don\\'t tend to want to get up or do anything else when you\\'re on your computer, right? Well that needs to change. Often, peolple get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one. Some people are so obsessed, they might even break down and have a fit! Nobody want\\'s to see someone throw a fit because they have to get off the computer do they? If they don\\'t get exercise anytime when you\\'re not on a computer it can deffinately shows. Jimmy @CAPS2 syas, \"\"@CAPS3 @NUM1 kids are on their computers way to much! They never come out of their rooms, and if they ever do, then they are normally very cranky. They\\'re getting fat! I can tell because all they eat is junk food. This needs to \"\" @CAPS4 can\\'t even have a little of time with his children. They should go on a family trip and enjoy together! That brings us in next issue. We all need to enjoy nature more. Why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your . It\\'s because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy and go outisde. The best thing about nature is that if you are  about need to be alone or even just need to get , nature is always there for you anytime you need it. You can laways go otside with your friends and family too!. I\\'m sure that they would apreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together. Yet again, our next and final issue. Computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends. When talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun? ALso, when you spend time with your family, it brings them a lot closer toy ou. Nobody likes to not talk to the people you love and the people who reised you. When you\\'re on a computer I just think of all the places you could , place you could be with. Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family. Therefore, people should turn off their computers, go exercise, be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family. Thank you\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1695\\t1\\t\"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know, @CAPS2 people are starting to buy and own computers. Some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors. I disagree with this statement. First, computers help us with every day life. We check news on computers, some people even use their computers @CAPS1 a @CAPS3 and watch important shows. Second, a computer is a great way to comunicate. @CAPS10 its friends, family or even buisness, a computer is a excelent way of communication. finally, a computer is help when it comes to school or work. You could write a paper on the computer for example read on to see how I support my reasons of why computers are helpful in peoples lives. Have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about? Well, @CAPS10 you had a computer, you could go online to the news website and read more. This is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life, there are plenty more. Another way is @CAPS10 you don\\'t own a @CAPS3, you could watch your favorite show on the computer. My english teacher @PERSON1 says \"\"I never owned a @CAPS3, I only watch @CAPS3 on my computer and I like it better\"\" In fact @PERCENT1 of people who watch videos on the computer like it better than @CAPS3. This is how computers come in handy in every day life. I love how computers have @CAPS2 ways of comunicating. I like it because I have @CAPS2 relatives who live far away and I use my computer to comunicate with them from time to time. Skype is my favorite, I can see the person @CAPS8 talking to at the same time. Also computers can be good for business for large companies who need to comunicate out of the contry. I\\'m sure being a amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy comunication. finally, comunication with friends. These are @CAPS2 programs for this, @CAPS9 @CAPS1 facebook and myspace. This is why a computer is a good way of comunication. finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. It\\'s much faster than writing. Also, @CAPS10 you need more info on something, you could look it up online. like @CAPS10 you are writing an article on dolphins, you could learn more about them. In conclusion I think computers are good things. They help with everyday life, They are good for comunication. And last they help at school or work.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1696\\t1\\t\"Wouldn\\'t you agree that computers are needed in our life. I would, we need computer for many things, for example we need computer for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. Next this is good for buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @MONTH1 have missed as if you was absent. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @MONTH1 be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Now a days many college students with work going on @MONTH1 not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. With computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @CAPS1 from the I have told you like communications, education, and buying and selling products I hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1697\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you love haveing the enternet at your finger tips. Recently, it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I firmly believe that this is correct. My three arguments are its not healthy, the friends you meet up there are siber friends and bad @CAPS5 @MONTH1 occur. First of all, being on the computer too much is not healthy. This reminds me of my friend named @CAPS2. @CAPS2 used to be humerous, outgoing and play alot of sports. One @CAPS3 day, her mother bought her a laptop. This laptop was blue and white-her two faverite colors. She was on it all day and all night. She took it with her everywhere she went. Well, it got to the point whare she stopped the sports, gained some weight and the sadness creptped upon her. She was in a depresion mode. She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only. She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @CAPS2 she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. Second of all, the friends you meet on the enternet are called cyber friends. You don\\'t know who they realy are, where they realy live, or their real age. They can tell you any thing they want because they know that that\\'s a little fantasy world. That is mently not healthy. It is very important for human beings to be socialy active. Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also. Third of all, @CAPS5 @MONTH1 pop up. If you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get like becky, it is not good for you or the device. Being on the computer can harm even the computer. Well, you\\'ve read my arguments and ideas. Please take them into consideration.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Teenagers just can\\'t wait to chat with their friends on facebook and instant message. There are a lot of positive and negative things about computers. In these paragraphs below I am going to give you my opinion, tell you how people can manage there time better and the effects it can have. My @CAPS1 experience with computers is that they have @CAPS3 much information but sometimes it can be too much. Today, a lot of children and teenagers are getting bullied. People can send horrible messages to someone. They rather do it on the computer because they don\\'t have to say it to there faces. that is one thing that I don\\'t live about computers is that people can get harrased. Other then that I think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past. Not a lot of @CAPS2 want to see there child coming straight home from school and go right to the computer @CAPS2 have to be strict with there child when it comes to computers. They need to manage there time @CAPS3 they can alson do there homework, after school activities etc.... Studies have shown that children who go on the computer every single day for more than two hours are most timely to see their grades drop. That\\'s why if you mange your time it wouldn\\'t be a problem. You want your child to have a balance in there life, @CAPS3 manage the time where they are not all day long. There are positive things about the computer and as well as negative things. The computer is a great way to research people you are learning about in school and find people from your past for example, facebook is a great way to stay connected to your old buddies. Google is also a great tool because you can type in anything and it wil give you a hundred websites to chose from a negative effect about it is that people are likely to say things on it to other people that they wouldn\\'t dare to beg to there face. It also prevents you from doing other things because you get @CAPS3 consumed about the computer you forget your main priorietees. In these paragraphs I gave you my opion on computers and how there are posotive and negative things about them. I also explainted how it can taking up your time with your main priorities in life and how to manage your time wisely. The computer is a great tool but don\\'t get take to much advantage of it because it is not a priority.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

You can study different foods and cultures around the world. If you play games online you can get better hand-eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convinient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world you can type in the name of the place and get facts about cultures, foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see @LOCATION1, you can go online to learn @CAPS1 language. You can also study food s that people eat and the clothes they wear. You can also learn sports and games. If you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination. Most games you can daunloads and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge you, action that are fun and take rapid button pressing, and adventure that let you explore new lands. And in alot of these games you can talk to people and make friends. There are otherways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, facebook, twitter, and video chat. With any of these things you can talks to friends or family around the world or in your state/country. All of these you can either download, go on the internet for, or buy them. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you havent seen in a while. Video chat you can see eacho ther, face book you can share pictures and chat rooms you can talk with multiple people.

Whether it\\'s studying the world, having fun, or talking to people you know, the computer has many wonderous things for people\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1700\\t1\\t\"What is technology? Technology is defined as anything that helps enhance our way of living. Technology is all around us. Our beds, houses, televisions and even chairs are all forms of technology. There is one form of technology however, in my opinion, has revolutionized modern day living as we know it. This form of technology is called the computer. My outlook on the effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive. Just think of all of the things we rely on this device to do. There is one thing, however that really sticks out in my mind; @CAPS1. The computer is perhaps the greatest form of @CAPS1 the world has ever seen. E-mail is basically sending a letter to a friend without the hassle of mailing it out where it might get lost or stolen. E-mailing is two simple steps: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Not only does it lower the risk of the letter not getting there, but it is also much quicker. You hit the \"\"sen\"\" button and before you know it, a new letter is sitting in you friends inbox. Another method of computerized @CAPS1 is my personal favorite, instant messaging. Instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away. And it\\'s okay if you decide to go get a soda while you are instant messaing because unlike a real conversation, that isn\\'t rude. These are just two methods of @CAPS1 that the computer enables us to have. Tehre is a variety of other that, much like these two, enhance our way of life. I believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing: the internet. The internet makes everything we do on the computer possible. If i want to gon on the computer and do research on a topic, the internet takes me where i want to go. With millions of different websites, the internet has endless possibilities. If I\\'m interested in arcade games, I can go on the internet and play them. If i have to write a science report, then i can go on the internet and collect research. If i want to listen to music, tehn i can go on the computer, look up a song, and listen to it. And guess what? If i\\'m looking for a funny video just for a good laugh, then the internet can find me one! The internet is perhaps one of the greatest things ever invented. It\\'s just another reason to love the computer.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

But some experts believe they don\\x92t which is why I\\'m writing this paper so that I can explain the positions from both sides. Did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. Computers believe it they help us in life wether @CAPS1 to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. It we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @DATE1, @CAPS1 one of the most important devices. Let me share my expierence okay. I had a job interview right well I could not find that street so I went on my computer and it gave me the directions I made it to my interview. Thats why I think computers have posotive effects. Now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. Well I have some people spend to much time on their computer @CAPS1 completely choice. And those are people who usually don\\'t have alot of self control. And exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. For the interacting with friends and family you can do that I mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. So in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

My brother; for example, @CAPS4 went to a university there @CAPS4 learned how to become a micanic. @CAPS4 was having a hard time finding a job, (looking for me on the street) so somone told him to go on @CAPS1.com and go to \"\"@CAPS2 @CAPS3\"\" @CAPS4 did and there on the computer @CAPS4 found a good job and still works there.

       " '1703\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle schoolers growing up, I believe using computers can be beneficial at same point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of innapproprate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to \"\"hack\"\" or tresspass someone else\\'s computer. Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download innapropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use. criminal acts, vulgar language and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that \"\"@CAPS4 @CAPS5\"\" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, apperance, and age. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won\\'t be so much \"\"fun\"\" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @NUM1 hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be innappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. More and more peole become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my oppinnion.\"\\t5\\t6\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1704\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper, I support the advances in technology, and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I think this for @NUM1 simple reasons, @CAPS1, you gain computer skills, which can help in other situations. Second: Computers give people the chance to learn about faraway people and places.Lastly when you have a computer you can chat and talk to other people. When I think of a computer, I think of typing or a keyboard. After a few times of using a computer you get @CAPS2 and better it. You gain, typing skills, hand eye coordination and mouse skills. After jusst a few uses, your computer skills build up and you soon get good at it. When you do get @CAPS2 though, you get better quicker and more so it all works out very well. When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search anything and everything. Weather it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is helpful. When I am doing my homework, and I don\\'t know how to another a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get help with any homework I need help in, its great.I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but theres no one to talk to? Well that problem can be solved very simply, get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone half way around the world. Its amazing you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. A computers chat you to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. Computers are great. When your on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it. They are helpful and fun you never run out of options with a computer at your side. In my opinion, there is so much to gain and learn from a computer.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1705\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen I earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. The question is what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. Computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! Whetver it\\'s clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. A cording to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was on the computer. Sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don\\'t let it overwelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @ORGANIZATION2 like that! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. When you need information on the line. But why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what\\'s the newest fads, what\\'s carrently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old-fashioned @CAPS7-mail, you can use a device in the @CAPS8 called someone. You of course need a @CAPS9 to do thank one. I remenber a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn\\'t answer. I then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. Sure enough he was! I got the home work and got an A all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others.\"\\t6\\t6\\t\\t12\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1706\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a good effect on people and not a bad effect. I think this for three reasons. My first reason is that they relieve stress. Without a computer in my opinion things would be a lot more stressful. With a computer you can easily look things up without wasting time or being stressed out by having to look for something. My second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is technology. Without technology things would be so much harder. Without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments, print out pictures, and getting information. If we didn\\'t have technology as in computers I think a lot or things would go wrong. My third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them factories would crash. i say this because if you think about it could in a factory is ran by some type of computer. Without that computer telling the machines what to do everything practically wouldn\\'t work! without the computer everything would become so time consuming that no one would want to get the work done. These are my three reasons why I think computers have a good effect on people.\"\\t3\\t3\\t\\t6\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Well, if you are, I believe that should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom says only an hour aa day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and (or) play over a friends house. Yes, playing on computer is fun, but you have to execise to. (you know) @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors. Like that\\'s how I met trees, animals, beautiful senery. You could feel like you were having the time or your. The last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use. you could make snowmen in the winter or if it\\'s raining you could watch a movie. you could build a lot. In conclusion building, playing and jumping (the list could go on) You can enjoy the outdoors. Just rember the three good reason why are you could use the wonderful and lovly outdoors. Go walk you dog, have friends ober or even just having out with your family and friends.\"\\t4\\t3\\t\\t7\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

The computer is like a disease or a virus that controles you and gaining your freedom from it perfectly possible. I understand that some people @MONTH1 not agree with me, however I propose that my side is the best. This is horrible. How can it? It distracts people from their life. I makes them blind to enjoy nature. Spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease. The hard part is to get in your freedom is being able to know that it is ocntroling you. That way your door to freedom will be open. The tecknologie keeps you away from having fun, doing homework from school and having fun with friends. I know that you can break free from it because I once experienced the same thing. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed. I has so many information in it you wont even think a person it. I know even more than . However it is also very foul. Once I came up on a very horrible seen on the computer. I my i can shut it . Michines have a mind that it our and anything it. Changing a persons life is not easy. You become complitely new. Sometimes those changes are good sometimes they are bad. But a michine can make you change in ten minutes. Once you see what you like on it or what you want you can change. If you see something and you want it so bad. I you cant get if then you will be forced to get it by stealing. It is a very horrible thing to learn. All you have to do is learn to controle your self. Machines are a very bad influence on people. There are book if you need information.

The three reason why they have a good affect on people is because, it gives you good typing skills, its educational, and it helps you out with alot of things. The first reason why computers have a good affect on people is because computers help your typing skills. If you have a computer you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good. Each time you use the computer your hands ajust to the keys on the computer. Say if there is someone that wants to work with computers when they get older, well if they practice their typing on their computers at home they will be eligible for the job working with computers. Also computers could be good for the hearing impared. If the hearing impared use to the computers then they can get a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 and chat with people online. This would be useful to them because since they could not hear what people say they can read what people say through the internet. Another reason why computers have a good affect on people is because they are very educational. In my opinion, computers are very educational because there are alot of websites that teach you facts about different places. For example, what food people eat in different countrys, or where that country is. A website that is the best for finding out accurate facts is www.Ask.com. Ask.com is the best website because it tells you what ever you want to know in a matter of seconds. Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites. The last reason why computers have a affect on people is because they help you with alot of things. They help you with alot of things because if you want to know how far @LOCATION2 is from @LOCATION1 then you can go on your pc and find out, or say that you lost the directions to your friends house and your on your way to their house if you brought your labtop you can go on the labtap and find where her house is from your labtop. I know your probably thinking there is such thing as a gps, well if you think about it gps\\'s can be confusing, but your computer reads it out to you. Know your probably saying in your heads why don\\'t you text/call @CAPS3/@CAPS4 if you think about it what if your friend does not talk clearly. In conclusion, wouldn\\'t you agree that computers do have good effects on people. My three arguments are, they help your typing skill educational.

       " '1712\\t1\\t\"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 say that people are spending too much time foucusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are @CAPS1! Computers are a giant step into new technology. For example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online and give children some down time where they can learn about far away places and people. If you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly relized that you forgot one of the most important books! You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. Computers then come in handy. You can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson. Children @CAPS2 to commonicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends children would be knowhere. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, childeren can do reaserch, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about far away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now availble. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers @CAPS3 would not know the important news when @CAPS3 needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future (yes I am repertative) @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future. So all the people of @LOCATION1 keep your computers, they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology. Plus who would not want a good computer game once and a while.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

People\\'s body start to get lazy and don\\'t want to get up. They are not spending time with the family instead they would like to spend their free time on the @CAPS3. This is my people should stop being lazy and have some fresh air. @CAPS2 you people who spend time on the computer interact with their family? Well, no, because they think they will get entertain by technology instead of their family. The reason I don\\'t like compter so much because you get hook on so fast you can\\'t stop. When you interact will family you get to know them better and that is priceless. This is why it should stop because it damage peoples minds. Another reasons I would like you to hear is less time exercising. When people don\\'t exercise you will @CAPS2 anything to their body. They start to eat too much and later they become very lazy. When you exercise you have tons of energy to @CAPS2 anything. Like bunge jump. When you excerise you look healthy and people will notive. This why excerise is the best healthy and always fit. In addition, my third reason I would like you to read is enjoying nature. Enjoying nature you can have a good time and relax. You can swim in the beach, feel the amazing breeze, and have a good time. When you are on the computer you are sitting down instead going outside and that because a habit. It will be hurting are environment because people don\\'t want to get up to enjoy nature. This is why it should not be tollerated because people are being lazy. In conclusion, the reason why people should not spend their life on computer because they think they will be entertain by technology instead of interacting will their family.

If your friend is in @LOCATION2 are other faraway places your friend can bring there computer with him or her so your friend can just talking to you by talking online, you dont have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other places. You can also learn how to type, when you know how to type you can type faster and faster. You can type storys, poem, and notes are something you have to do at school, so you don\\'t have to write on a pace of peaper you can just type on computer.

In my opinion, no computers definitely don\\'t make people lazy and less interactive with others aroud them. First, I think that computers can sometimes make you smarter. I mean you can read about history, world news and you can research many different topics. I remember when I was younger I would love to learn about the @CAPS1. I use to search it all the time and I made a poster project for fun. Thanks to the computer I got accurate information. A survey conducted by the @CAPS2 school social studies teacher shows that @PERCENT1 of their students used teh computers to find facts for school projects. @PERCENT2 out of that @PERCENT1 end up getting better grades. Famous psycologist @PERSON2 says that \"\"kids and students learn more when they are on the computer researching or @CAPS7 new things.\"\" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that too much internet is unhealthy for people but mostly syudents. But at @ORGANIZATION1 it a good source of @CAPS7 for them. Therefore the computer helps teach everyone facts and many stays on whats going on around the world. Second, people can interact with family and friends online. i mean there\\'s @CAPS3 where people can socialize with their families who live out of state. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade I made a new friend and she moves to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I keep in touch with her on @CAPS3. A survey conducted by student council at that @PERCENT3 of students had someone they know and love move away out of state @PERCENT4 out of taht @PERCENT3 keep in touch by email or @CAPS3. Famous scientist @ORGANIZATION2 says, \"\"People who keep in touch with family and friends tend to stay happy and not become depressed.\"\" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that people don\\'t need to keep in touch with their families all the time but it makes them happier. Therefore people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families. Third, you can learn new exercise, moves or tricks. I mean you can do new exercise, train for dance competition or learn new magic tricks for you magic show. I remember when I wanted to learn how to twirl a balon between my fingers I went and found a video of someone teaching step by step on how to do it. its easier now. A survey conducted by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 shows that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members get stronger and more fit by @CAPS7 new exercises. Famous athlete @PERSON1 says \"\"@CAPS7 new exercises online helps me stay fit for my games\"\". I know you @MONTH1 be thinking taht they can just go to someone to teach them BUT no one wants to pay money for something you can get free online. Therefore, @CAPS7 new exercises, moves or tricks online can help them out a lot. To conclude, does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? No, it helps them learn, socialize with family and friends and they can get in shape with the new exercise that they learn from how to videos.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

So people in the world basically have a computer but not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1, I think that our country should write a big pay check to those poor country and so they can get computers and so if they come here they can speak our language, or we ship that of computers to their countrys and so they dont buy any crappy computers. Also when your on a computer you can buy a webcam or it is already placed into your computer and you can talk to your friends or even show them that what you made or something like that.

Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment, but when it comes to boredome computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Also excersise is a big issue now and you aren\\'t getting any by at a computer. On the other hand though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn\\'t healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public. Also these w ebsites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Other pass time could be running on a tredmill or jogging there dont have benefits. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day but not using to the internet. Websites can be a way to find computer time. Edline is homework or an assignment. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive.

       " '1719\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 about what the world would be like without computers. Scary thought? I had the same reaction. A world without computers is a world of non-communicating people and no where to gather information independently. The benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that don\\'t live in your area or that you just haven\\'t talked to in a while. They also teach hand-eye coordination which is good for almost anything. Lastly, they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world. In conclusion, computers have outstanding effects on people. First of all, in my perspective, having a computer, allows me to communicate to people I\\'ve met on past vacations. I can email, them and talk to them on social networks such as facebook. This is benefical to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family. Being able to talk to friends I haven\\'t spoken to in a white, gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect. In conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer, is only I, of the many benefits a computer has! Second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand-eye coordination as well. Dereck was a channel @NUM1 news reporter, \"\"I can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. I truely @CAPS1 it\\'s because my mother teached me now to use a computer! \"\"@CAPS2 especially benefit from computers because they teach them hand-eye coordination which is great for those homeruns, or even touchdowns! Third of all computers allow students and many others to learn and look up things they don\\'t know. @PERCENT1 of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research. On the other hand, businessman, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. Overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand-eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. As a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and a success for realiable information!\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1720\\t1\\t\"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 in your newspaper, I read an article that sparked my interest. The article was about the negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn\\'t help but disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my opinion, computers are a step in the right direction for modern technology. I believe computers are a benefit to society because they premote hand-eye coordination, you can learn about almost anything, and you can talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand-eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer your eyes are on the screen while your hands are typing and strengthening at an incredible rate! A study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand-eye coordination you get from typing, goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So if someone needs to build up their hand eye coordination I suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of calling a number, why not go online and plan your entire trip from your computer. There are so many websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, sites can teaching people how to clothings are always nearby. If you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in \"\"how to knit\"\" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make a great or fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things the internet allows you to friends. After camp, I would always say \"\"oh we will keep in touch,\"\" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very easy to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I believe that computers are a benefit to the world because they help with hand-eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and talk to people.\"\\t5\\t6\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

I personally don\\'t use a computer that often just to check my email and school work but that dosn\\'t mean that people don\\'t need them. People get excirsize even when they don\\'t knew it like walking have so they are not of that. I personally believe that computers are not bad for but they can be helpful like a research projects like if you don\\'t feel like looking book to find information you could go on a computer and look up somthig you could have the information at your finger tips. Why are peope so concerned about what we @CAPS4 with our.

       " '1722\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 people are talking about computers and what it does to us. People believe that using the computer is a waste of time. I believe that computers aren\\'t a bad thing. Using the computers can help us learn about other places in the world. It can also show us the lives about people from the past. We can also talk to our friends online. If you want to know why computers are useful, just keep on reading. People say that computers waste our lives. I disagree with that opinion. The internet is a great way to learn about different places in the world. We can learn about the climate. The animals, and the food they eat. @CAPS1 palces have different types of culture. For example, in @LOCATION3 everyone eats seafood. In @LOCATION2, everyone eats spicy food. The internet can show us pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before. It\\'s a great way to see and learn about different places compared to how you live. Do you have a friend that you haven\\'t seen in a long time? Would you like to be in contact with that person again? Well the internet is a great way to do this. It allows you to make an account such as twitter, facebook, @NUM1 and more. You can search up your friends name and magic! You finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again. You would be thrilled to be able to talk with them again. @CAPS1 kids use the computer in order to do their history projects. Well the internet is here to help. You can search up famous people from the past or people from now adays. The internet allows you to see and learn about these people\\'s past. One example is @LOCATION1. He was the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1. You can learn so much about him like where he was born, how @CAPS1 family relatives did he have and more. So you see, the internet is a great use for kids. These are my reasons in why I believe that computers aren\\'t bad. We still have time for family, friends and any fun outdoor activity. We can learn about different places in the world. We can talk to friends online, and we can learn about people from the past.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Instead of going to the library and hoping that theres a book on him. You can just @ORGANIZATION1 his name and hundreds of different websites using will came. That will save a lot of your day and it will save a lot of you money. If you go on a family trip each year to the sum. Place you need a change? Then you can look up another place online that @MONTH1 has the same features but it @MONTH1 be way closer then going to @LOCATION1 each year. So, if you have a computer then you can look places you @MONTH1 want to travel to or look up cool facts about your future sport player. If you have messy handwriting and its getting harder and harder for your teacher to read then you can just learn how to type it up on the computer. At least @PERCENT2 of students in schools today are getting zero on homewrok or test because their teacher can\\'t read their hand writing. If you type it up on a s computer then you will spelling or grammar as you ever you for sizes and color as pictures are make your grade high to the fact you little more work into you die. So, to all the people who think that computer help anyone well reasons why computer can help someone.

       " '1724\\t1\\t\"Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, Have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society? Well, for numerous people, computers are their lives. They help adults stay in contact with their friends. Also, it gives users usefull information about anything you can think of. Computers are a great tool to help us with our lives, they help us learn skills for later in life. People who use computers do not spend too much time on them, we need them to live a good life. For example, the internet has many websites that keep people in touch. There are countless sites and to name a few, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, the list goes on and on. Many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on. With computers, you can chat with each other all night. In @CAPS4, it is also a convienient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @LOCATION1. Moreover, computers are chock full of information. If a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. Also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the info for the report. Lastly if someone had an ailment and didn\\'t know it was serious enough for a visit to the doctors office, they could look it up on the internet. they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as @ORGANIZATION2. Lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that these who don\\'t will never have. Just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college. For instance, making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard. In @CAPS4 , typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. And using the computer fine tunes hand-eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 say that staring at a screen all day isn\\'t healthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. Computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. The time has come to tell the people computers are usefull to society. They help social lives, teach us skills and, give us information on countless topics. People need them to have an enjoyable life. So, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @DATE1 and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them. \"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

There are no friendships or communication with other countries. Is this really what you want? Computers do have positive effects on people. For example, they help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers have a positive effect on people and the society. First, hand eye-coordination is not something that all people have. However, you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact. Computers @CAPS4 said that computer help @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 with their hand-eye coordination. For example, my mom used to have horrible hand-eye coordination but now that she uses a computer and it is much better. Oprah said, \\x93 @CAPS6 I was young I couldn\\x92t catch a ball but now that I\\x92m older and using computers I\\x92m the best.\\x94 @NUM1 out @NUM2 people agree that computer help hand-eye coordination. Next, computers help other people learn about faraway places. For example, if we didn\\x92t have computers people wouldn\\x92t travel to @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 agree that they would never travel if it weren\\x92t for computers it is a fact that people use the internet to learn about other countries for educational purposes. Www.exploretheworld.org wrote that @PERCENT2 of the people who use the website are students. Computers help other people learn about far away places. Finally, computers allow people to talk online. @PERCENT3 of people on facebook have at least one friend who live out of this country. It is a fact that countries are better allies @CAPS6 their people get along.Www.internationalfriendships.com wrote that they have over @NUM3 users who talk with people from other countries for example, my friend\\x92s mother was born in @LOCATION2 and she talks online with many of her friends. Dr @PERSON1 said,\\x94@CAPS8 friendships are the best kind because you learn about other cultures.\\x94 Computers are a wonderful way to talk to other people. Now @CAPS3 a world where every country got along because of online friendships. Where adults could play a game of baseball because they got their hand eye-coordination back. Where students could learn about distant places they didn\\x92t know existed. Does\\'t that sound great? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allow people to talk online. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers do benefit the society.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. Computers are taking away family time, exercise privledges, and time spent on school on school work. \"\"@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play \\'@CAPS3\\' with us!\"\" @CAPS4 mom\\'s will say this to childeren at least once as week, the answer that is @CAPS4 common is \"\"@CAPS5!\"\" @CAPS6 childeren from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer weather it\\'s playing games or talking with friends. This is on issue that needs attention. Families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother that is always playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with @PERSON1 play computer. Aport from spending time with family computers take away @CAPS6 kids exercise privlidges. One example is that last week it snowed and I wanted my neigbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me but, she said had to finish a level on a computer game and it was realy important. This proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise. A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to @CAPS4 people except for @CAPS4 teenagers would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actualy spending time with them. Lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen. When does homework got done? I took a survey recently among the eighth grade and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of the people that don\\'t do their homework are due to spending too much time on the computer. In my science class a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. I asked him why one day and he says it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. @CAPS5 time spent with family, @CAPS5 exercise getting done, @CAPS5 time to play outside, and missing homework assignment are alot to sacrifice for \"\"@CAPS8 one more level.\"\" I you want to help me get childeren not spend so much time on computer, write on artical on this important issue in one of your newspaper and please consider my ideas.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of familys dont talk because they are to preocupied with computar games. The issue to grapple with is @CAPS1 computars have an affect on people. Yes, I think that computars have a negitive affect on people based on the following reasons. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enought exersize, they dont enjoy the nature that we have, and they dont inter act with there family and friends. People spent to much time on the computar and dont get enough exersize. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of people that are over weight spend more time on the computar than on the track.

One day my mom took the computar ant threw it out the window and I had no chioce but to go outside and get some exersize. @CAPS1 you want kids to be over weight like I was? Many people dont get to enjoy the great out doors because they are to preocupied with the computar.

Statistics show that @PERCENT1 ofdevorces are related to not being able to have aconversation and with more technoligy on the way that number will grow.

In my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item. I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, they allow people to stay in contact with people they dont see very often, and they allow people to keep up and know whats going on in modern life. One reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they don\\'t see very often. Today, parents don\\'t mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1. This feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today. People in @LOCATION1 can talk with people in @LOCATION2. This type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they\\'ve discovered. Another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life. Many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. Some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. With computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. There is even at home colleges now where you take your class online. I believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only. Finally the last reason I believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet. There are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things. Also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @MONTH1 know a lot about the topic. Another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic, read history about it, and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more. Overall, I believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years. I believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge, the ability to keep in touch with others, and to keep in touch with modern life. I believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies. So, most people in a couple years will be computers and use them effectively.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1729\\t1\\t\"Computers have gotten more advanced over time. They have even gotten smaller and smaller, and yet people still don\\'t understand the dangers that computers have on society and their personal life such as; stress, addiction, and cyberbulling. I am here to write about how computers are a nuisense in our lives. First and for most, computers are one of the laeding causes of stress in daily life. About four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers. For example, if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes, would you be upset? Would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window? I\\'m pretty sure that you would because your data is lost, you will have to restart your computer and, worst case senerio, take your computer to the electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus. Hacking was @CAPS1 become a world wide sport. There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer and the government can\\'t do much about that since the first amendment gives you the write to publish what you (freedom of speech and press). Just look what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors will cause major stress in you daily life. Secondly, people spend too much time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer. This make them less social meaning they won\\'t spend time with friends, family, or even try out for sports. They won\\'t get the recommended one hour of exercise a day.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1730\\t1\\t\"Many people debate on whether on net computers have negative effects on them @CAPS1 believe have negative effects on them @CAPS1 believe computers are an asset to society because you can access almost anything. That is the problem. The content on computers is affilicted upon everyone that sees it, Computers also don\\'t help people get healthir, anf if you need to research something books are more help than the internet. For starter, the contents on computers and the internet are too much for people and society. @CAPS4 I\\'m saying is way too much can be accessed on the internet. Derrogatory and pornagraphic websites harm people the @CAPS1 especially @ORGANIZATION1 and teens. Chinese government officials have cut off access to the @CAPS1 dangerous websites. Chinese readers started \"\"@CAPS3 belive the things that are easily accessed on computers are poisoning the minds of the youth.\"\" The internet and computers are  waiting to explode and invade the minds of everybody. Secondly, computers aren\\'t metally from computers but physically unstable also. Computers offer of games for @ORGANIZATION1 to play. These games start off fun but they become habits. Don\\'t get me away though games can be fun but when a child plays a game for hours a day there is a problem. The problem is that kids are not getting enough of the exercise they need. Studies performed by the @ORGANIZATION1  know that @PERCENT1 of child who play computer generated games are overweight. Therefore I believe games are harmful habit to young @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, many people do research on the internet. but some facts are actually @CAPS4 im getting is that no one need a computer to look up or do research on projects. Instead go to a library. Many find books boring but it will help in the long . I remember a time when i had a project dure for @PERSON1\\'s in @NUM1 grade on @LOCATION1. I looked up information on the internet instead of using a book just to learn that the facts were actually highly in accurate . Therefore, never depend on the internet as a source of research. from derragatory content, to unhealthy youth, to innacurate research. Computers are not assets to society but issues. In my opinion i believe computers are actually doing more harm than good to everbody that uses them.\"\\t4\\t6\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Why I stated that is @CAPS2 its unhealthy for many people. Its not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don\\'t want to be in. Stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get of the computer! It\\'s unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead he just sit there online everyday eating. Another reason why its unhealthy is, as you get older your bone\\'s get weaker and when your old you can\\'t move lik you use to and want to. Man just think, if we didn\\'t have a computer, all the time/money people spend on computers can be spent for stuff more useful. For example @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love computers more than life itself. @PERCENT1 of the world spend their time doing somthing active instead of being on the computer.\"\" @CAPS3 an computer is nice but you got to know that you, can\\'t get controlled by it.

But it wasn\\'t me who the cops was coming for, it was my next door neighbor. I guess he was doing illegal stuff online that he had no buisness doing. See computer\\'s can get you into trouble. For example, I remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me. Now, you know why computers effect people. How unhealthy it is, to many people. Why it takes up so much time from people\\'s life. And all the trouble it puts people through.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1732\\t1\\t\"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 are a major part in everyday life. They are used by just about everybody. There are so many benefits if you know how to use one propurly. They help you through everyday life whether your trying to find this song that is stuck in your head or trying to file you taxes, computers are a nececity in every house hold. They are also a great way to learn. You can look up a question that has been buging you or you could learn to play a new song on your favorite instrement. Either way your learning. So I think that computers deffinetly have more of a positive effect on society then a negative one. Computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends. Some computers even have built in cameras that lets you hold conversations with peers through the computer while seeing each other. This is great if you have family that lives far away, or your in a long distance relationship. Another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things. Wheither it been @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 you can count on your computer to keep it all organized some computers also have a built in callendar that could help you plan out your day. But say you don\\'t know what to do that day. Well that brings me to my next point. Computer are also great for looking up places. For instance say you fly to @LOCATION1 for the first time on a buisness meeting and you arrive a few days before the meeting. So maybe you diside to go sight seeing to some of @LOCATION1\\'s most eligant spots, but have a computer you could look up some spots and be on your way to having a great day. Overall I think that computers make the world go round. They will never die out, that is why everybody should know how to use one, and if you don\\'t you should hurry and learn as soon as possible.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1733\\t1\\t\"I think that computer are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people and even allow people to talk with other people. My first reason, is that important people around the world used computers to have a better future on life. The people that use computers have important jobs. For example, a judge, an enginere, a lawyer, an archytecht, a scientist, an archeologist etc... This is why I think that computer are helpfull for people. My second reason, is that computer could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school. It could help develop a smarter brain in many ways. The first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is reading a lot on the compute. It helps by knowing the meaning of new words. I helps you speak correctly and clear. That is why I think that computers help develop a smarter brain. My third reason is that it help adult connect to different places at the world. That could be a hobby for adults that does not have something to do could have a good time. My conclusion is that with computer you could have a better life. Computers could help you get a better future.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1734\\t1\\t\"Dear conneticut @CAPS1, you like to catch up on your favorite television showscar shop for the latest trends? Or maybe even planning out a get together with some of your old friends? Well with todays great technology you can do that on the computer! I can see that the experts are trying to decide whether or not computers are the healthiest thing that benefits our society but in my opinion I think they are great! As you @MONTH1 not know I am @NUM1 years old and have a @NUM2 year old brother; we spend alot of time on the computer not just for homework. I like to shop online for discounts and sales where I know thing are cheaper than in stores. I know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games. My grandparents are older and don\\'t watch alot of tv and read the Newspaper so the computer is great for catching up on your favorite tv shows and or the news. With these great pieces of machinery you can chat up a storm with old friends on facebook, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION3. @PERCENT1 of teens @CAPS5 are shopping by brand names, like: @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4. All of these clothes and designer stuff is everything we want, but half of us don\\'t have the money. If you go on the computer you can get all of these names and items for less than @MONEY1 compared to %@NUM3. Computers lower the price of things we want and need. I, @CAPS5 a days grandparents try to have a decents conversation with their kids or grandchildren but they go right vack to when they were little. As a grandchild to my @PERSON1 all she used to talk about was her days going through the great deppresion, but with computers she got to catch up on the news and @CAPS5 I can sit down with her and have a great conversation. You can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school. The kids won\\'t be missing out! When I was in @NUM4 grade I got my first facebook, I thought I was so could! That @DATE1 I went to camp and met all these new kids and found out that they all have facebooks. @CAPS5 I keep in touch with them, with out lossing my friendships. You see, I know the scientists or experts are probably smarter than a @NUM1 year old girl but I know that most teenaters and parents have facebook and say its great because we connect with people around the world. So I know these experts are going to make the best dicision on whether or not computers benefit our society but please take my ideas into consideration.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

In addition to all this some people can task and many things like hang out with there family and friend but most importantly enjoy life. In a way computer privliges can be as like your enjoying life. Say if you an your friend has the same computer which includes webcam, video messaging and more. That\\'s life well what im trying to say is that yall can talk see each other, have private conversations. Computer\\'s dont alway take you away from the important people or things in life. Some computers can help you, you can take school, learn how to write essays, learn how to read, and much more. Computers can be a success to some people. Only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer. Imagine life without a computer what would you do? How can you survive? For example if you were giving some homework that you had to do on the computer and theres was no way for you to do that project in school. How would you do it? Some people need computers. I think if they thought and knew we was going to get so excited about how cool our computers\\' are they shouldnt so much new technologies in our life. Now you can probably see why I think we need computer and how it can sometime benefit our society.\"\\t4\\t3\\t\\t7\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1736\\t1\\t\"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one @ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a @ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First @ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students\\' handwriting. I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn\\'t want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn\\'t possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn\\'t have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn\\'t talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn\\'t understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad\\'s boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn\\'t a possible effect, then I don\\'t know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I\\'m you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think computers @MONTH1 cost too much, but you @CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I know that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree.\"\\t6\\t5\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. Also you can get information on places you will visit. This will help learn about diffrent contrays. Most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. This concluds that you can learn things on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will come in handy for familys. Also people who have hospitilized family. Plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. Most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I agree with computers. They have a possitive affect on people. They given us ability to learn! Lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away.

I agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is because sometimes theirs teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they cant contact them in any other way. Another reason is because in all school teacher give their students project to do over vacation or weekends, for the projects they can look for information in the computer. The last reason is because computers can give ability to learn more about things they didnt know before. In my opinion I agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids and even adults would like to talk with their friends so they can get on the computer and chat with them if theirs no other way to contact them, @CAPS2 easy. You only have to @NUM1) get in the computer, @NUM2) get into a site were you know your friend might be @NUM3) log in or register in if you never been into that site @NUM4) last but not least look @NUM4 your friend to chat will teachers always give their students work for example like projects. Kids also do projects on weekends or vacation and so you dont have to go to a library to check out a book you could always get on the computer and look for the information you need their. Computers give you abilitys to learn information you didnt know before for example if your bored and you dont got nothing to do get in the computer and look up information about things like nature, books your looking for etc. I agree with computers benefiting society but not everyone, @NUM3 reason why I agree is kids can chat online with their friends, look up information for projects and find information they never knew about, what do you think @CAPS1 I right or wrong.\"\\t4\\t3\\t\\t7\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1739\\t1\\t\"Dear State legistator, @CAPS1 you live back a long time ago when there were no computers. The only diffrence now is the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder. I deffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone elses lifes easier. With the computer it teaches hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I belive the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from \\x93@CAPS2 drivers.com\\x94 the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decraced over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like \\x93@CAPS3\\x94 a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pa. the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in \\x93@CAPS4-tech\\x94 magazine. I should also add in it has reconected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online. So do me a favor state legislator relize and come to terms how much society needs the computer.\"\\t4\\t6\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1740\\t1\\t\"I think computers have a good effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordiantion, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and allow them to talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. This will be used through out people lives. WIthout hand-eye coordination people will be clumsey. Hand-eye coordination is used from day to day everyday. Using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time. For people who do not have good hand-eye coordiantion this will be a big help. They will be able to do more thing without messing up. Like hitting a baseball! For kids who want to play sports this could acually help. They will learn to use there eyes, arms, and hands to there advantage. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places. If we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world. Also if you have family in a faraway place you will be able to look online and see what is happening there. If something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them. Also to be able to learn about faraway places will help in school. If you have a report to do on of faraway place instead of looking through you can look on the internet for information. Computers also allow people to talk online with other people. This gives more comunication. You will be able to make more friends and better friends. To have the opportuniy to talk to people online is great. You can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot. Also you will become a lot more interactive with people. If you are a shy person this can help you. You will get used to talking to people and when you get comfortable you will talk to them in real life. This will make you a lot more friends. This will help you come out of your shell and become a lot more interactive around people. These are three reasons why I think computers are a good thing. They help hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and allow you to talk online with other people.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Plus computers let you chat to people on there computer even if you can\\'t call them. Another reason why I love computer are because when I have to write a project I can just type it!!! Computers make eveything easier. So, @CAPS2 consider liking computers. Initially, imagine you have a project due in two days. Your mom can\\'t drive you to the library and you have no information on the subject. But hey, don\\'t you have a computer. You can use the computer to lock up your subject and a @CAPS3 different websites will come speed quick to your screen.

Secondly, @CAPS4 @CAPS5!!! you frogot what page of the book your suspose to read. Also you lost all your friends contacts. Not to fear super duper computer is here. You can email or chat to your friends online and see what pages to read and get there phone numbers back. Did you know @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 People said that the chat & email programs are @CAPS6 because they can contact friends, family, and co-workers. Finally, you can type your essay on the computer. Writing a @NUM2 paragraph essay takes to long, so use your computer to help you out. Go to microsoft office and type your essay. Computers make writing an essay really easy. @PERCENT2 out of @NUM3 people said they like typing on the computer more then writing it on @CAPS7. in conclusion, Computers are @CAPS6 tecnollogy when you have to chat to someone.

If we did not have computers I would not have finfished many of my school process and homeworks. But the experts who are spending too much time on thier computers & less time exercising enjoying nature & interacting with family and friends.

Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I beileve that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the @PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don\\'t have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use internet know that poeple need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone dosen\\'t want to be bothered then don\\'t bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don\\'t brag, but just know you are privleged for a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I @CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: \"\"I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay orginized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, \"\"my dog ate my homework\"\" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without earasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get @CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you @MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are @CAPS1, ext. No more, \"\"I didn\\'t know/remember what was homework/project due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to @CAPS1 what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a dobt, no more, \"\"I\\'m bored\"\". @CAPS1 you use your computer to @CAPS1 anything like this? If so you must enjoy it.

But to some, the effect its giving on the people is negative. However, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. Such as, the internet allows people to keep in touch, gives them technology skills to prepare them @CAPS1 more hi-tech jobs; and allows them to find and learn about new things. Dont you think computers help society? People live in all parts of the world, and those that are lucky get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country. But, you can\\'t talk on the phone due to long-distance calls; so with a computer people don\\'t have to lose touch! Its quite easy @CAPS1 people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them. Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family, too. Therefore, people can talk to their distant relatives from all over when you don\\'t even have to go visit them. Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch. Lets face it, the world is relying more and more on technology and computers. But, if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job. Lots of jobs ask @CAPS1 technological skills in order to be hired; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults @CAPS1 life. Besides that, there is a computer injust about every work place that is up-to-date; restaurants, hotels, retail stores. and even in construction business. Nevertheless, computer skills aren\\'t just a good skill to have; they are a necessary skill. Last, Computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics. Instead of looking through various books and encyclopedias @CAPS1 researching, why not search the topic? Although, the computer and internet shouldn\\'t completely replace books, it is a valuable researching tool. Someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures, ancient history on them, and learn so much. Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house. Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people. @CAPS1 the reasons of keeping intouch, giving\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Letters also take forever to recieve, while instant messeges come, well, instantly! Haven\\'t seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are being made with webcams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be talking with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor. Don\\'t think that\\'s enough? If you explored the computer, then you\\'d find it can help you with a lot more than just learning and interaction.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1747\\t1\\t\"Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don\\'t have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can\\'t do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can\\'t. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1748\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don\\'t fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

You can save you picture, download music, play games.

       " '1750\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper, People all around the globe are using computers! Some people think this is a bad idea but I disagree. I believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style. Computers help people stay in touch, computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways. Computers definitly help people keep in touch. There is @CAPS1, myspace, twitter, facebook, email, and even video chat. For example, my cousin is in @LOCATION1 a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat. Without this, we would have no communication with him. Many people around the world use computers to communicate. This is how people use computers to stay in touch. Also, computers are amazing now and they\\'re only going to get better. If computers are so great now, just imagine what they will be like in @NUM1 or @NUM2 years. Plus, the more people buy and use computers the more company are going to want to invent new ones. As you can see computers are only going to get better. The last reason I would like to share with you today is that computers help kids tromendously. On average, about @PERCENT1 of kid in the @CAPS2.S use a computer every day. Kids use it to talk to friends, play games, do homework and to do many other things as well. Also, kids and adults just use computers if they need to know how to do something or even find places in their town. This is how kids are helped out by computers. As you can clearly see, computers are used all around the world for many different reasons. They help to stay in touch, they\\'re only going to improve, and the help kids. Everyone is using computers, shouldn\\'t you?\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1751\\t1\\t\"Dear local newspaper, I strongly belive that computers don\\'t benefit society as much as people think. I think that nature can provide all of the same qualatys than any computer can. A computure can not provide fitness, real interactions with friends of family, or experience in the real world. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children in @LOCATION2 are overweight because of a lack of exercising? Acording to @CAPS1 @PERSON1. a @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1, computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise. So why would a system that leads to obesity be considered a benefit to sociaty? Anotherthing on that topic is that overweight children that spend @NUM1 hours. Put off healthy activatys such as basketball or tennis wich also leaves them socialy behind and lacking he healthy experiences wich leads me to my next point. People think that computers know everything, but the truth is that their are vary little things you can experience on a computer. For example you @MONTH1 read about world war @CAPS2 but you realy know what people were thinking or what the combat fealt like? A computer can not teach you how to feal only a real life experience can do so. Many if you were deployed to an army write in @LOCATION1. You would know what its like to be in war. but playing a game or reading an article don\\'t provide experience. My @NUM2 explamation for how computers are not the greatest affect on scociaty is true life interactions with your family and friends. Their is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally. People claim that they talk to their friends and family over the @CAPS3 all the time but the only why to be satisfied is by seeing them for real for example a romantic relationship would fail if the only way they communicated was threw the @CAPS3. Unlike most relationships that sucseed. I hope my letter to your newspaper will get peoples attention, I would apretiate it if you joined my cause and help protect scociaty from dangerous computure technology that could cause, obesity, bad relations, and inexperience.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1752\\t1\\t\"Computers are great technology, but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives! Computers cause children to fail and lose their exercize. The children also put their self in danger by joining a few different websites. Don\\x92t waste your time in a boring computer screen! I am almost @PERCENT1 positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their back packs in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. My mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @CAPS1, when he would only go one @NUM1 minutes a day to talk to family members. Now, my mom created a @CAPS1, that @CAPS2 said @CAPS2 was gona only go on to with the family, but @CAPS2 plays all the pointless applications, such as, \"\"cafe world.\"\" @CAPS2 waste her time on @CAPS1 whenever @CAPS2 is home, when @CAPS2 could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. Something I havent mentioned is, I use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didnt go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I relized after I got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. My dad then disconected my @CAPS4, and I beleive my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconecting the @CAPS4, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @CAPS3 home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There\\'s also a website, \"\"blogtv.com.\"\" were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it\\'s disterbing! Stop wasting your life people! Go out and have fun, dont let the @CAPS4 keep you home. The @CAPS4 is unsafe and pointless.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

They are warping the minds of people all over, and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be. Some people @MONTH1 disagree, and say that computers help children who are in school. That @MONTH1 be true, but honestly only a couple decades ago the average student didnt even own a computer, and school were teaching the same materials without the usage of them. Also, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays, and I\\'m sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools. Another reason computers @MONTH1 not benefit society is because of the dangers of them. Sexual predators sworm the internet, and many people talk to strangers over the internet that @MONTH1 be harmful, without even realizing it. A third reason computers @MONTH1 not be help society @CAPS2 you can see, I feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society, for many reason.

       " '1754\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 the men and women who write everyday for a living, I would like @CAPS2 you were to write rection on computers. They teach @LOCATION3 faraway places, help build hand-eye coordination, and let @LOCATION3 talk online. Computers are part of everyday life and needs to be told about. First, computer let @LOCATION3 learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. One of my mom\\'s friends, They decide to move to @LOCATION2 she didn\\'t like computer so didn\\'t look at @LOCATION2\\'s laws saying, I\\'ll find out when I got there. \"\"@CAPS2 did find out the laws she didn\\'t find enough cause cause she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few monthes after her last arrest she came back to the @LOCATION3 where she could deal with the laws. @LOCATION2 is a buetifull country and all of arrests were accidents because she didn\\'t know the laws. Ten minutes on computer searching the laws in @LOCATION2 could have kept her in @LOCATION1. Next, comptures improve hand-eye coordination. From a survey @PERCENT1 of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. @PERSON3, a gym teacher at the @ORGANIZATION2 says, \"\"@CAPS3 of these kids that spend time on the compture are weak and need to get some exercise.Dear local newpaper: @CAPS1 you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT2 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand-eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, \"\"I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. @CAPS5, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on.\"\" @CAPS5, the people agree with what @PERSON2 stated. However, people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but @CAPS2 you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirly, @CAPS2 you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because @CAPS2 you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. @CAPS5, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other peoples life is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research faraway places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. @CAPS5, I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful and people use them everyday without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever @CAPS2 you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot! From so many students having greater hand-eye cooridination they will enjoy what their good at like tennis. @PERSON1, a professor of the human body at @ORGANIZATION1 states \"\"Technology helps hand-eye. Many who use computers more than others to be greater at @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and games along those lines.\"\" This shows how hand-eye and exercise is linked to computer. Furthermore, computers help @LOCATION3 talk with other people. When a child goes to college they will still be able to email their famlies and talk to them. Talking with others by computers makes the world go round. World business need computers to contact eachother to decuss plans on how to move toward economicly. Lastly, computers are useful and should be useful more. They teach @LOCATION3 of faraway places, improve hand-eye coordnation, and let @LOCATION3 talk to other people. @CAPS2 an article is made to show the pros or computers, more people will experience the wonders of them.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1755\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are used everyday by millions of people. I believe that the technology of computers have a positive effect on people. I think computers have a positive effect on people because people use them for research. People use computers to communicate with people far away. Computers are even used as a news resource. In my opinion, computers make things easier. Computers have a positive effect on people because they are very helpful. You can use computers to research different things. @CAPS1 you have a computer, you can learn new things about places you never knew existed. For example, @CAPS1 you have a homework assignment, you don\\'t have to use a book to get information, you can just use your computer. So, for those reasons, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are always being used for several things. However I think people used computers the most for communication. On a computer you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states. Instead of sending letters to people by mail, now a days people use e-mails and instant message. You can talk to people faster this way and it\\'s much easier. Computers have a positive effect on people. It\\'s makes some things in life much easier. I don\\'t understand why they would have a negative effect on people. It\\'s the year @DATE1, and computers are used for basically everything. Remember how we used to have to read the newspaper to find out about breaking news and important things? Well, since we have computers a lot of people don\\'t read newspaper. On the computer you can read the whole newspaper, and even find out more about things that happen in our world. So what\\'s the point of even reading the newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? I believe computers have a positive effect on people\\'s life because you can do anything on the computer. You can research information, commmunicate with people, and use it as news resource. Doesn\\'t that make lif a lot easier? So why do some people think computers have a negative effect on people?\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Take away your computer and all youre doing is sitting thhere, not burning one calorie, or exercising one muscle, [expect your fingers of ] @CAPS2\\'t you think you should be doing something more usefull in your life?

Go to the gym and loose some of that extra body weight! Communicating through @CAPS5\\'s is so over-rated, people can\\'t express their emotions! all they can do is send a smily face or happy face. Communication wih only your friends can cause you to miss out on things. For example, lets say there is a cancelation at your work place on the news, but you @CAPS2\\'t see it cause you were @CAPS6-ing with your friend. @CAPS6? @PERCENT2 of people @CAPS2\\'t even \"\"laugh out loud\"\" @CAPS7 they send that to their friends.

I believe that computers have a bad effect on people because their communication skills will drop, people won\\'t get enough exercise & their health can be imnarred. As i mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis, will drop their communication skills.. People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to. For example, if i logged onto & chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number & your name. This could lead to things such as kidnaping & even rape. Also, interactions with family members & friends @MONTH1 decrease. You can be playing a computer game, online, or going on youtube to watch random videos of people. You tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children. Kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on when click the wrong one bringing them inapropiate website. Finally, teenagers and adults go onto facebook & twitter. Some @MONTH1 say these sites @MONTH1 change the social interactions, but it really isn\\'t. Kids & adults are constantly getting addicted to it. Also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal. People don\\'t need to know when you do things in your day i have keep up this our communication skills are sure to decrease. Secondly, exersice is a problem. Doctors say that @PERCENT1 of their parents are obeise or over weight according to @ORGANIZATION1. Kid just sit at home & play computer games such as sims @NUM1 & video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them. No one really goes for walks any more either.

She went to her eye doctor because her vision was become weaker. One of the first questions he aske was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? she answered yes. He said she would need cataraks eye surgery. This was all in result of using a computer. Finally, you could get althritis in your hands & fingers from typing & using the mouse all the time. Many people at the age of fourty are probaly going to need hand surgeries from all the work the do, likes! As you can see technology is harming your communication skills, exersice & you health.

The internet also contains alot of unappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many petafiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on peoples lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in america is climbing. There is no doubt that electronics, play a huge role in this event. For example my brother plays on the computer everyday, so barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to occupy his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also there is alot of content. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornagraphy. most sites don\\'t even alert you that by how you need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very little acctually ask for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be deal with. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children as a young teens. Its truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and. Petafiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive, to lure young teens unto meeting them in a secure location, and to commit rape. Some victims are enough speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so this is all made possible through the internet.

Also, people spend too much time in front the computer now a days, @CAPS1, its a major distraction and also a negetive effect on kids. school work. It\\'s now or never! Do we dicide that computers have a negetive effect? You decide! Isn\\'t every parents biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don\\'t even look for bad things, they just pop up. Would you want your child veiwing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like @CAPS2.com one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least @NUM1 to have a @CAPS2, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users lie about their age? And it\\'s not always a @NUM4 year old saying they are @NUM1, it could be a @NUM6 year old saying they\\'re @NUM7! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are. Is this the kind of internet exposer you want for your children? Put a stop to this right now! More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are overweight and unhealthy. This is another negetive effect computers have on people. It\\'s a gorgeous @DATE1 day. Bright blue skies, cotton candy cloulds, the sun is shining, and there\\'s a nice warm breece. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! None people would @CAPS5 be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would @CAPS5 spend hours on facebook. This is a serious concern to our health. People don\\'t exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! Instead of playing video games onlin, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun beighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step @CAPS3 need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn\\'t you agree? Did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negetive effects of a computer this will @CAPS5 than coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can\\'t expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study. So you do! Take action now, or your child will definately suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe Computers have a negative effect on people? It\\'s clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negetively affect children\\'s grades. Don\\'t wait another minute! Let\\'s agree and do something about this!\"\\t6\\t6\\t\\t12\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Some users are addicted to their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, they are away from friends and family, and they are not exersizing it if fun to use the @CAPS4 but you should not use it too much! Some people are almost addicted to their @CAPS4. I cant blame them they can charge their ipod, tweet, listen to music, palying games and much more all at the same time! computers are great, but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of activities. People almost feel (some do) that they HAVE to go on facebook to harvest their crops in farmtown, or control their @LOCATION1 on @CAPS3. They get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities. It shouldn\\'t  that for but its became an epidemic, eveybody is being sucked into their computers! People who are on their @CAPS4 @NUM1 are away from their friends and family! they are like oh i haven\\'t talked   his surgery i wonder how he is! Lets see! They go on and  You can talk to someone in just a click! Talking to someone  facebook or twitter is no the same as talking to them in person! Its like people think computers is     @CAPS4 take people away from their friends and family and them talk only on facebook  .When people on the @CAPS4 they become lazy! A person who is @CAPS4 addict will say \"\" @CAPS5 supposed to go to they gym but let me check my twitter first!\"\" two hours later then they go the gym! People don\\'t exercise as often as the should! When people are going to lay on the @CAPS4 for @NUM2 minutes it takes @NUM3 hours! They have to sign in, chat with their friends, check their mail look at their tweets look at their restaurnat  check out videos on youtuve and do all other kinds of things!

I wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer. First, kids and even adults can talk to there friends online. Your popley thinking that the kids already some there friend at school but what @CAPS2 their moved. They could have moved to a different city, State or even cuntry and the only @MONTH1 to connect with them is by They can\\'t call each other @CAPS2 they really far away that would be a pretty phone bill. Seventy five percent of people talk to thier friends through computer. About half of the people are talking to friends who live in another state. or country. Do you really want people to lose their friends? Next, people can actually make new friends in the computer, like pen pals. Pen pals are people you write to but they don\\'t live in the state as you or sometimes not even the same country. assignment at school but you can do it on your @CAPS2 your pen pal doesn\\'t live in the same country as you and doesn\\'t speak fluend @CAPS3 you can teach them @CAPS3 and they can teach you these language. Finally, there\\'s away for kids to go on the You could a limit on thier computer time Some wants to paly a game on the \"\"@CAPS5 you can play on the computer away from her the next day. @CAPS2 wants to go on the computer that day and throws a ten turn the parent should take the computer away for the next and so on and so on. Once your child finally cooperates they will get the to use the computer. As you can see there are meny things to do on the computer from talking to far away friends to making new friends a computer schedule. Thank you for taking you time to read this letter.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1763\\t1\\t\"Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1 you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect becuase, they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and home work updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function @CAPS8 computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interviews with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, \"\"I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload @CAPS8 @CAPS3.\"\" @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, \"\"@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics.\"\" A lawyer said, \"\"You can not support a client if you don\\'t have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is on @MONEY1 those tools.\"\" @CAPS4, @CAPS8 computers offices would crumble and students grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper @CAPS8 a @CAPS5? Secondly internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as \\'@CAPS6\\' and \\'@CAPS7\\' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the nation says their friend groups have expanded to the groups (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, \"\"Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; online bloom.\"\" @CAPS8 internet, citizens @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries\\' people. My next reason, however is even greater. Lastly, @CAPS8 internet, people would do for less traveling. Internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way @MONEY1 booking where the tourist shall stay. Apoll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 the travelers book their flights online and @CAPS8 online ticketing \\'the wait to book your flights would be unbearabley long; or stop travelers completely\\' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people each. We inquired about how the bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 @MONEY1 them said online. \"\"@CAPS9 do you mean, how? On the internet @MONEY1 course! no one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!\"\" said a person interviewed. Airports make @MONEY1 for the @LOCATION2 government, and @CAPS8 internet less people would travel. There for, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways @MONEY1 booking transportation. @CAPS8 computers internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me.\"\\t6\\t6\\t\\t12\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1764\\t1\\t\"Dear @PERSON1, The advansing technology is showing a very negative affect on people. Because of computers people are spending too much time on computer and less time doing things that are better for them. First, spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways. For example, looking at a bright computer screan for more than @NUM1 min at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. The brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision. Also, if you spend all of your time indoors and on the computer you will not get the exersize you need. @PERSON1, were you aware that for every @NUM2 min you are on the computer you should spend @NUM2 min outside. It is very important to get fresh air, sunlight, and exersize. Moreover, another problemwith computers is that you don\\'t get as much interaction with people. With online chatting you can\\'t know what the other person is feeling like, @PERSON1, or if you are even talking to other person you think you\\'re talking to. It is much better to interact with people in person, face to face. To have good social health you need to hang out with friends, and laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. @PERSON1, people need to interact with real people. Furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people. For example, @PERSON1, say you needed to type up an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a min, or look something up, or talk with a friend. You say that it will only take a minute and then you with type the article. But when you stop all of a sudden you played for @NUM4 hours. Then you have to stay up later to finish. Computers are extremely distracting. People of all ages have this problem of being distracted by computers and not gettind work done. In conclusion, computers, although an advance in technology, have very negative side affects. @PERSON1, I feel that it is our job to tell the people of the negitive side effects of computers. It is our job to help people over come the side affects of computers. Please @PERSON1, we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

       " '1766\\t1\\t\"Man has always been interested in technology. Computers are just one part. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, saves trees, and allows people to learn about everything. Hand-eye coordination is a key part in our every day lives. Driving a car or writting all invile hand-eye coordination. I remember a few years ago I didn\\'t have a great hand-eye coordination I had trouble catching a ball. Now days I spend up to on hour and a half on the computers. I have noticed my hand get neater and I can catch a balls with ease now. Do you want to be the one to crash your car because you have bad hand-eye coordination? Computers not only increase your hand-eye coordination they save trees too. Using a computer dosn\\'t need any paper. You can read and write with out using a single sheet of paper. Since the computer @PERCENT1 of tree cutting has stopped. Saving trees help us stay alive. Trees put out the oxegyn that we breath in. Some say that computers are causing people to spend less time enjoying nature. I think that if it wasn\\'t for computers we wouldn\\'t have much nature to enjoy anyway. Lastly computer help people all around the world learn about almost anything. I scince kid, the head scientist says that \"\"with the computer we are able to toll the world of our discoveries much.\"\" @CAPS1. @PERSON1 say \"\"@CAPS2 many people are laying had their die to the computer, they learn @CAPS2 many nutrition facts from the health sites\"\". Thanks to the computer we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed. The average people can learn about non average things any day. There are even dictionarys on the internet with many diffent translations that you would normily need about @NUM1 books to do. The computer is one of the greatest techlonagicly advances to this day.

       " '1767\\t1\\t\"Guaranteed, @NUM1 years from now we will still be using computers they are probably talking to friends, doing research on something or are typing up something for @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are wonderful and let us do so many things that we can\\'t do by ourselves. Without computers life as we know it would probably be way different. Firstly, computers let us talk to our friends and family. Allowing us to communicate to one another without us leaving the safety of our homes. See, just recently a girl in @CAPS1 went over her friends\\' home to do their homework together. When they were done the girl tried to walk home, and she was never seen again. With computers we can do homework with our friends without leaving our homes. Clearly, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Secondly, computers let us do research about stuff we don\\'t know about. Allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that maybe not have the info. you\\'re looking for if it was to search @ORGANIZATION1 it would give me a map pointing out it\\'s location and the schools website where I can find out my homework for that night. As you can see the computer allows ud to do things that would take us far more longer to do regularly. Without a doubt, without computers life as we know it would probably be way different @CAPS2, Computers allow us to do homework on it wether it\\'s research or just typing something up, it lets us do more capable things. Most of our daily homework is on the computer. Just @DATE1 we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our @ORGANIZATION1. So far in @NUM2 grade almost every night our homework is on the @CAPS3 if we were to forget to write down our homework we would have another to get this information. Obviously, without computers life as we know it would be way different. Furthermore, computers are on advancement in technology that this uses constantly. Computers let us look up valuable info. on things around the world. They let us talk to friends and family around the world. They @CAPS3 help us achieve great things in @ORGANIZATION1, wether it be homework or classwork. Without them it would take double to triple the amount of time to do something without them. Finally, I believe that people who are against them just haven\\'t used them in the correct manner.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1768\\t1\\t\"I think the effects of the computer are bad, these are my three reasons why I think its bad; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time or hours on their computers, @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers, @CAPS3, people need to use computers out a less time. These are the three reasons why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that computer could cause couse blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers because the screen of the computer has too much light, people can\\'t just stop staring at the monitor and even worse they could probably lost their sight and they will end up with blindness. That\\'s why you have to be away from the screen but, being too long on your computer is bad. This is my @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad because the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers. The @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers because when people are on their computers too much time they just couldn\\'t come down stairs talk with their family of friends, they could\\'nt go outside and enjoy the glory of nature and the enjoyment at the outside world, and also if they had nothing they can just read a book, draw, watch the @CAPS4, etc. They could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers. This is my @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers. The last reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to use their computer for a less time because when people use their computer for a less time it is good because now they finally could be with their family and friends and spend so much time with them. It also good to saving energy, and prevent you from paying alot of electrical bill, and also it is good to finally let your vision of the eyes to relax. In conclusion, the three reasons; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer. @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computer, and @CAPS3, people need to use their computers for a less time will prove that the effects of the computer I think its very bad.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1769\\t1\\t\"Dear editor, I think people are using computers to much and are not benifiting as much as loosing from it people are getting less exercise, not seeing nature, and not spending no much quality time with their family and friends. Read on to find ou more. First of all, people are not getting enough exersize. Especialy children, They spend to much time on computers and are becomeing over weight. America is in a crisis with child obesety. So computer have chipped into that. Many adults are over weight because they sit at computers and work as play games all day. I reason that computers are more unhealthy for us. Secondly, people are not going on hikes or trips to see the beauties of nature. Earth has many things to offer, new things to explore and discover. People can be discovering many great wonders. Finding new species, is something you need to explore nature for: animals, fish, plants, there are many out there waiting to be discovered. Reason @NUM1 why computers are not benifiting us. Thirdly, family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should. Realitives you talk to over computers, why not talk to them in real life. friends chatting online on facebook, aim, things like that, why not talk to each other in person and have fun memories with each other? More kids are spending time on the computer than sitting down eating a family meal together and expreriensing what a family should talk about. Reason @NUM2 on why computers are not benifitting us. In conclusion, Computers are taking over our minds and were not getting much exersise. Seeing the beauty of nature, and spending less more with their families.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1770\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren\\'t even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, \"\"where\\'s the nearest @ORGANIZATION1\"\" or \"\"how much does something cost.\"\" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don\\'t cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don\\'t fit in your pocket, but there\\'s always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people\\'s lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

With all these hours wasted in the virtual world, people are lacking in exercise, leading to many problems. They are also avoiding nature outside, and losing contact with family and friends. I think that computers are causing way too many problems and peerhaps, with some consideration @ORGANIZATION1 my evidence, you could come to think the same. Statistically, the @ORGANIZATION1 is the most overweight country. One @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons? Hours @ORGANIZATION1 sitting at the computer replaces healthy exercise @CAPS3 are all spending our lives on the computer, and sitting and clicking is not exercise. The great lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise is causing health problems. Not exercising can lead to abesity, which damages joints terribly. Then, diabetes developes, taking away from the quality @ORGANIZATION1 your life. Finally, there is heart disease, a top killer in our country. All this from spending time on the computer? you @MONTH1 ask @CAPS4 the amount @ORGANIZATION1 time @CAPS3 spend on computers is much more damaging than this. Every day is beautiful in its own way, and sometimes @CAPS2 is beautiful to us, in saying that beautiful to us (when @CAPS2 comes to the outdoors) is clear skys and a warm-temperature. These days come quite often, but what does @ORGANIZATION1 do? Glance out the window and go back to texting on that @ORGANIZATION2 laptop. Our bodies need this @CAPS5, @CAPS5 @CAPS6. @CAPS3 get @CAPS2 from the sun, and without going outside, @CAPS3 don\\'t get @CAPS2. not traveling outdoors deprives our body @ORGANIZATION1 an important @CAPS5. @CAPS2 affects more than just our health, as well @CAPS7 inside on the computer keeps us from having expenence real experience. @CAPS3 learn things on the computer, but only virtually. What happens when @CAPS3 are forced out into the real world and cant really do anything? Everyone loves having friends and family, so @CAPS2 doesn\\'t make sense why @CAPS3 would rather email them with trivial things instead @ORGANIZATION1 talking. Instant messaging doesn\\'t really bond people, as conversations are planned out you have time to think, so the person doesn\\'t know what the real you would say. This frays the bonds between people, and once @CAPS3 can\\'t work together, even with family, @ORGANIZATION1 can\\'t work together at all, and nobody wants that. Computers take away too much to be spending so much time on. Blatantly, they are bad for people. Not only do they effectively cause abesity, they fool us into thinking @CAPS3 can do things that really, @CAPS3 can only do virtually, and make close people come apart. @CAPS2\\'s ruining @LOCATION1.

One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn\\'t you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna\\'t afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like \"\"see you at @NUM1\"\", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don\\'t you think that is great? Think about it. \"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people; and even allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a beautiful thing! Ask yourself this, how would computers have a positive effect in your life?\"\\t6\\t4\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1775\\t1\\t\"Dear newspaper, In my opinion computers do benefit society because a computer is like a big electronics dictionary and they help our soldiers stay out of the line of fire. Computers benefit our society because they are like an electronic encyclopedia. Instead of leasing through a dictionary page by page trying to find a word, all that you would have to do is go on the internet type in @LOCATION1 and in the search box type in the word and every thing pops up. When i have to write a paper on someone I usually use the internet. The other day I had to write a paper on @PERSON1, so I went on the internet, found a website, took notes, put them into my own words and made a works called page. I thought that was easier then finding time to you do a and then find out there  only childrens books on that person. And you can also look up places like @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, or if you need to find out where a place is use @ORGANIZATION1. Computers also benefit our society because they are like big cellphones with a huge keyboard. My big sister is always on the computer using @CAPS2 talking to her friends. This helped her learn to type. Also there are new things like @CAPS3 where you can play games with your friend and talk to them while youre playing. Lastly computers benefit our society because they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. When I watch futureweapons I see unnamed helicopters that can be controled from hundreds of miles away. Also there is a robot used that digs out mines which saves many lives. When I interviewed @CAPS4 @CAPS5 from the military he said, \"\"@CAPS6 use those helicopters all the time. @CAPS6 also love how noone has to be in the helicopters so @CAPS6 don\\'t have to worry.\"\" In conclusion computers benefit our society because they are like big electronic encyclopedias, they also are like big cellphones with huge keyboards, and lastly they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. In school @CAPS6 use computers all of the time for writing papers and researching different things.\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1776\\t1\\t\"Technology, such as computers are very big. I belive computers have a good effect on people. People that use computers mostly use it to connet with family do research, or to be neat and not write it on paper. I belive that people who don\\x92t think computer make a good effect on people shouldn\\'t bother wasting their time using one. @PERCENT1 of people only use computer to connect with family. Usually your family either lives far away or in another state and you dont get to see them very often. Thats why I think video chating on the computer is a good thing. Also is a family come up you could @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 your family members instead of calling them because they would talk to you forever. Lastley if you use myspace, facebook or twitter you could connect with old friends and not just family members. \"\"@CAPS2 my teachers enjoy it when I use the computer to do my work, they said its alot neater\"\" said @CAPS3 romano from strong middle school. Teachers perfer it when you use the computers to do your work. When you are writing a book report or you are writing a story, you would want to use,icrosoft word of something to write out your paper so it is easer for teachers to read. Also if your in science class and you need to make the chart you would want to use exal to make the chart or graph look more professional. Lastly is you wanted to do a presintation on bloody @DATE1 or little @CAPS4 nine you would want to use a power point instaed of just reading from note cards. If people didn\\'t have google or yahoo they wouldn\\'t know what to do, computers are very good for research. If a student to do a presentation on something they would want to know more about it and look,the topic up. Also if your family was having a discusion at dinner and you had no idea what they were talking about you would look it up online, lastly if you just wanted to find lyrics to a song because you and a friend disagreed on something. Once again I belive that computers make a good effect on people, good for connecting with friends and family. Good for being neat and lastly good for reaserching anything!\"\\t4\\t5\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1777\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper, Computers have advance a lot since they were first made. Some people see computers as a way to rot your brain, while others see it has a learning device. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to each other online. To start off, computers are bad because they can be used as a way to babysit a child. When you\\'re on the computer you\\'re just sitting there staring at a screen with pictures and words on it. Some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite, instead of taking the time to go outside. By growing up in an enviornment like that the children only know how to play on the computer. Kids have a lot of energy, and they need to do something productive, not play computer games and talk to their friends. All school day they talked to their friends, they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy. By using the computer as a babysitter, you as a parent are leading your child to obisity because all they do is games, and they aren\\'t properly taking care of their body. On the other hand, computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. If your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on @LOCATION2 that was do in a week, what would you do? You can\\'t fly to @LOCATION2 and ask the @CAPS1 people what you want to know. That would be a waste of time and money. And if you go the library and they don\\'t have any books, then you\\'re in trouble. But by using the computer you can find endless information about @LOCATION2, and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to. Also, if you were going to @LOCATION4, but you knew nothing about @LOCATION4 you wouldn\\'t be very confident about going. And you would feel like a tourist. But, if you went online and searched @LOCATION4, you could find the traditions, the clothing, and so much more. Lastly, if you wanted to know more about a famous person who isn\\'t around anymore, you could go on the computer and find pictures and what they did, how they became famous, and so on. Finally, computers allow people to talk online with other people. Say your grandma lives in @LOCATION3, and you can\\'t call to often because your phone bill will get to high, what do you do then? You talk online since you both have computers and it won\\'t cost you to call. For example, my grandma and grandpa both live in @LOCATION1. When we call there it costs a lot because they\\'re so far away. When they got a computer, we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on @ORGANIZATION1. Now, not only did we talk to them, but we also get to see them too. If your friend didn\\'t have a phone and you really needed to ask them for the homework, you could go online or on aim or facebook and ask them. You know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away people an places, and they allow you to talk online with other people.\"\\t6\\t5\\t\\t11\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",

And while there at the computer there not looking at nothing else but the screen and thats not good for anyones health if there just looking at a computer screen the hole time. Another reason why i think at affects people @CAPS1 there not eatin wat they need to eat there just eatin something quick like junck food so they could on the computer. All are this effect stay on the @CAPS1 people either go places or have atheres might not be going out time their effects need to\"\\t3\\t2\\t\\t5\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1779\\t1\\t\"Dear @LOCATION1, *@CAPS1*. Now I hear my favorite @CAPS2 tunes. A few clicks here and type in a word and I am watching a funny episode of \"\"@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 #@NUM1\"\". I go to my @CAPS5 page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are only some things I can do on my computer. As you can see I need my computer for many things. I am all for using computers and I think they are a useful resorce. But @CAPS6\\'t stop now, I have many more reasons for using computors. Thier not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, @CAPS6\\'t Use @CAPS7 @CAPS8!! I can\\'t stress @CAPS7 enough to say that if you need to talk to a friend far away @CAPS6\\'t drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long-distance calls. Go to @CAPS5, facebook, twitter, or something that will save you gas and money. Some people want to talk to thier friends in @LOCATION2 but they @CAPS6\\'t have any of these computer sites. Pursuade them too!! Another issue some face is, \"\"You need to get out and excersize.\"\" I have only one answer. Most people @CAPS6\\'t know the right ways to excersize. Then, they end @CAPS8 hurting themselves. If they just went online and found out that they could do a painless, priceless, fun work out that is very effective then they would not get in so much physical and finantial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to @CAPS10 more out in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn\\'t know what you could or could not eat? LIke I @CAPS9 say, \"\"@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11\"\" remember @ORGANIZATION1. FInally, if your doing a report or something formal, you want @CAPS7 to look nice, right? Well, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people in the @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting and 9/@NUM3 teachers mistake words that are messily hand-writen. This shows that if you use a computor @CAPS7 will not only show the word you wrote but also correct @CAPS7 with spell check. In conclusion, there are many benefits to using a computor. Lets recap, computors can save money, time, and gas. Computars can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility. Act now!!! Show others that there are benifits to using computers, show them all the wonders of this amazing machine, That is not only a time waster but a life saver.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1780\\t1\\t\"Dear Newspaper I think that computers were one @ORGANIZATION1 the best things ever created. They allow you to talk to people in far away places, help you learn about career and education choises, and you are able to learn about many subjects. Computers are here to help society not hurt it so why shouldn\\'y we use them? With @CAPS5 we can talk to people around the world or in space @CAPS2 that matter. You might not know it hut all @ORGANIZATION1 the communications in the world need a @CAPS5. There not the kind anyone could go out and but though. There satalites, the orbit the planet from space, @PERSON1, a proffesor at @ORGANIZATION1, told students at @ORGANIZATION3 that, \"\"A lot @ORGANIZATION1 every day items, such as rars and phones, all use some kind @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5.\"\" @CAPS1 computers let people communicate with each other. In addition to letting people communicate they help millions @ORGANIZATION1 people make educational and career choises. Most kids that go to college don\\'t know a lot @ORGANIZATION1 colleges out there. When my sister was picking what college she wanted to go to she didn\\'t know which one to choose. She sat down and looked up hundred @ORGANIZATION1 schools. after narrowing it down she had made her decision she had picked @ORGANIZATION4, a @ORGANIZATION3 she had never even heard @ORGANIZATION1 a couple months ago. People are in this type @ORGANIZATION1 situation all the time at @ORGANIZATION2 a survey was taken by all the students to see what they wanted their career to be, @CAPS2 the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the week students got to experience diffrent carrer options. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the students picked a different carrer after that one week. Have you ever heard the old aget \"\"@CAPS3 is power\"\"? well its true and computers are a great source @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3. they have many different subjects math, science, history language and much much more. people should be using this @CAPS3 at the @CAPS4 francisco national debate @PERSON2. Said that \"\"@CAPS5 are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places math. and even comunicating these are what computers should be used @CAPS2 not unhealthy games. You can learn about many new places with a @CAPS5. In @NUM1 grade my teacher had everyone do areport on a country me and my friend found this place we had both never heard @ORGANIZATION1. with the @CAPS5 we found onts @ORGANIZATION1 information on it such us its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts surely one would agree that a @CAPS5 is a great tool that should be used. It lots people communicate, helps in educational decisions, and you can learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a @CAPS5.\"\\t5\\t4\\t\\t9\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1781\\t1\\t\"Mom!!! Did you know that the human body has only one liver!!!, @CAPS1 I didn\\'t where did you find out, on the computer. I recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, and enjoying nature. I dont think that they should be concerned because the computer leave\\'s people with an open mind and teach people new thing. So the computer does a lot for people, give\\'s them the chance to learn new thing, a chance to chat with friends far away, and also expand your mind of travel. Computers can do a lot for a person\\'s life of know\\'lleage. Just yesterday I found out that the human body can not survive without its liver. The computer also helped me with my strugle\\'s in math, even though that\\'s what the teacher is for she is not always their, like when I am home or away on vacation and I just want to remember so thing\\'s in math. Its also help\\'s people who want to know new launage\\'s such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. So you see a computer has a big affect on a person\\'s life. Two days ago I did a video chat with my grandparents back in @LOCATION2 it was great. After six year\\'s not seeing my grandparents they really changed, and I was starting to forget what they looked like. I never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away I was surprised. I dont know why you experts are so concerned about computer taking away people\\'s live\\'s look what it has done for my family. I know that if one of you experts family member went away for a long time you would miss them and want to talk. Some people\\'s love to video chat like people in the army because they get the chance to see their love one\\'s. A two-way ticket to @LOCATION3, To see all those beautiful sight\\'s and taste their wonderful food\\'s look at that waterfall where is that, In @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 now I have to go their. The computer has shone me places that I have neve sene before. The computer is a wonderful thing. So dont be concerned about us and what we do on the computer. In conclusion dont listen to the experts they dont know what their talking about, for all we know they use the computer more than we do. The compute can touch you new thing, give you the chance to chat with family and friends far away, and open your mind on travel. The computer is not a bad thing all it\\'s doing is making life a little better step by step.\"\\t5\\t5\\t\\t10\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1782\\t1\\t\"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers are a good source of technology. The reasons which I am fighting for tell why, kids are in school more than half of the school day. Parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. To begin, kids are in school more than have of a school day. How could children stay on the computer when there in school learning? They can\\'t. In school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around. After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. Computers don\\'t have effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away. Parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online. Lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. If you don\\'t have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. Also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too! Another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports. We need our information! To conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider because, mny other people would be shy to wirte this and get it published in their local newpaper! I would like to say computers are not interacting with family, friends, nature or anything of that sort. We as a whole need computers to do daily life things, without be able to go online, or save files we would be lost! So I will say again to consider my ideas. Thank you.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1783\\t1\\t\"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 several reasons on way I that advances in technology are harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers on the outside world. Its also takes you away from family and friends. Lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet. One of my severl reasons on way I feel advanced technology is harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers @CAPS2 teens, adult\\'s and etc. The probem with this is that you never really know whos on the other side of that door, that chat room people can miss guide you into thinking there someone who there not. @CAPS2 example theres a show called dateline. This show is about how young teens put there selev\\'s online and grown or young men click on a picture of you and that opens up a chat line or as I say opening a door, you dont know who\\'s on the other side of that door. So these men online makes these teens trust them and make them feel safe if they are a friend you \"\"hey can I come over sometime?\"\" you this young teen thinking thats your friend says yea sure. Dont forget you dont see his picture so he come\\'s over and most of three men are looking @CAPS2 a quick fix. If you know what I mean. This is what go\\'s on during dateline t.v show just imarge how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing the difference is they dont get caught. Secondly on why is harmful to our socitey is because it takes you away from your family and friends. It takes you away from your kid\\'s family because that will start to fill as if you love that computer more then them. It take you away friends because they might say hey let\\'s go out to the mall or @CAPS2 a drink youll probably say check up on somethings online. This will one move slowly away from you, all over a computer you will start to lose the people most important to you. My last reason on why you can harm society with teconogly is because it takes you away from living your own life and doing thing\\'s you wanna do like online is a bunch of stuff that everybody else say\\'s is cool. Do what you think and feel is cool. @CAPS2 example if someone posted something saying @NUM1 guys lodon is so cool you gotta go there but youve always wanted to go to @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 thing is that you do get to have enough air outside like your skin will get pail and icky and this is why I feel that way. In covlsion all though some people might think that advanced tencogly is good well cleary there not because they open doors to danger, take you away from friends and family. Also it takes you away from what life has to offer.\"\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " '1784\\t1\\t\"Do a adults and kids spend to much time on the computer? Well I don\\x92t think they do. Sure they use it a lot but still it\\'s for enter to inment. Kids need to use the computer because it\\'s another way for them to communicate with each other. Textings good but it costs money, so does to lking on the phone. If a doesn\\'t have texting they can go on facebook or something to make make plans to do something with a friend. What if it\\'s a rainy day outside and there\\'s nothing to do? Well that\\'s what a computer for.Kids use the computer for entertainment. There\\'s tons of games to play. All on different websites of course but that\\'s beside the point. There\\'s mmorpg or rpg those are two type of games I can think of computers are like kids own virtual outside world. Computers are also needed to do research for school projects. Also to get pictures. Sure there book but they don\\'t always have everything you\\'re looking for. You can\\'t cut pictures out of books. You need a good grade on a project. Therefore computers need to be used a lot. for communication, entertainment, and school projects.\"\\t3\\t4\\t\\t7\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n',\n",
       " \"1785\\t1\\tMy opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.\\t4\\t4\\t\\t8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\",\n",
